# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



A thorough search of PubMed and CINAHL® from January 1, 2009 to July 31, 2016 was conducted.

The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) program conducted a literature search for pain prior to 2009. Thirty-four articles from the previous search were included in the cancer-related pain guidelines. These articles were subject to the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the articles for the new search. 

Studies published from January 2006 to June 2016 are included in the review.

**Pain Topic Search Strategy**

The following strategy was used across all four pain guidelines (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

**Databases Used**

_PubMed_

(pain[ti] AND cancer[ti]) OR ((pain[ti] OR pain[majr]) AND neoplasms[majr]) AND (("2009/01/01"[PDAT] : "2016/07/31"[PDAT]) AND "humans"[MeSH Terms] AND English[lang] AND cancer[sb]) 

_CINAHL ®_

  * (MH "Cancer Pain" OR (TI cancer AND TI pain)) OR ( MM pain AND (cancer OR neoplasms OR oncolog*)) 
  * Limiters: English language; clinical queries: therapy–high sensitivity, therapy–high specificity, therapy–best balance 



**Inclusion Criteria**

  * Full research report, systematic review, guideline, or meta-analysis 
  * Study must report results of measurement of pain, including acute, chronic, breakthrough, or refractory pain. 
  * The study examines a pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic intervention aimed at affecting pain. 
  * Sample must include patients with cancer. 
  * Include pediatric and/or adult studies 
  * Studies aimed at treatment of pain (may include other symptoms) rather than treatment of the cancer 
  * Sample size of at least 40, or 20 per study group 
  * For complex interventions, the description of the intervention must be sufficient to identify the components of that intervention. 



**Exclusion Criteria**

  * Gray literature 
  * Descriptive study 
  * Studies involving the use of standard short-acting or sustained or extended-release opioids (Only studies involving new formulations or unusual use of these medications will be included.) 
  * Studies involving examination of effects of different types of surgical anesthesia 
  * Studies involving surgical procedures as the primary intervention 



## Number of Source Documents



Forty-four citations are included in the review for breakthrough cancer pain.

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

- Expert Consensus (Committee)
- Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p>Panels of advanced practice nurses, staff nurses, and doctorally-prepared nurse researchers reviewed the literature base in the identified outcome areas. Professional health services librarians assisted in the conduct of the literature searches. Based on their analysis, the panels then formulated a judgment about the body of evidence related to the intervention under consideration. Three major components were considered by the panels in classifying the collective evidence into one of six Weight of Evidence categories (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field): </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality of the data, with more weight assigned to levels of evidence higher in the PRISM categorization (such as randomized trials and meta-analyses) </li>
    <li>Magnitude of the outcome (e.g., effect size or minimal clinically important difference) </li>
    <li>Concurrence among the evidence (based on the premise that an investigator has less confidence in findings in which the lines of evidence contradict one another) </li>
</ul></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) information resources supervisor thoroughly searched the literature according to the strategy and search terms shown the "Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence" field. Studies that met inclusion criteria were assigned to pairs of pain Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) team members, who reviewed and summarized included articles using a standard form. Each article was reviewed by one pain PEP team member and then peer-reviewed by the second pain PEP team member. The form included information about the purpose of the study and a brief description of the intervention, sample size and characteristics, study design, measurement instruments, conclusions, limitations that show risk of bias and threats to validity in design, and implications for nursing practice. Finally, PEP team members applied the ONS PEP classification scheme to individual interventions via Web-based meetings occurring about every six months. PEP team members included nurse scientists, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses. Classification considers all previous as well as new evidence for each intervention. Conferences are facilitated by ONS research staff and classification of individual interventions is determined by team consensus.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) program is a multifaceted project that involves the coordination of Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) staff as well as volunteer team contributors. PEP topic teams are comprised of volunteer nurse researchers, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses who have demonstrated experience and interest in a PEP topic. Topic leaders are nurse scientists or advanced practice nurses with demonstrated expertise in the topic through research and/or publications.

PEP team members applied the ONS PEP classification scheme (see the "Rating Scheme for the Recommendations" field) to individual interventions via Web-based meetings occurring about every six months. PEP team members included nurse scientists, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses. Classification considers all previous as well as new evidence for each intervention. Conferences are facilitated by ONS research staff and classification of individual interventions is determined by team consensus.

Teams categorize interventions based on the ONS PEP weight-of-evidence classification schema. The schema is intended to be used with existing research-based knowledge on health interventions and is based on previous research. PEP teams consider the entire body of evidence rather than a single study for classification, and more weight is given to studies that rank higher in ONS's priority symptom management project categorization. Team members also consider the magnitude of the outcome and the concurrence of the evidence for an intervention prior to assigning a classification. Interventions are classified by team consensus after application of the schema.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Recommended for Practice**

Interventions for which effectiveness has been demonstrated by strong evidence from rigorously designed studies, meta-analysis, or systematic reviews, and for which expectation of harms is small compared to the benefits

**Benefits Balanced With Harm**

Interventions for which clinicians and patients should weigh the beneficial and harmful effects according to individual circumstances and priorities

**Effectiveness Not Established**

Interventions for insufficient or conflicting data or data of inadequate quality currently exist, with no clear indication of harm

**Effectiveness Unlikely**

Interventions for which lack of effectiveness has been demonstrated by negative evidence from a single rigorously conducted controlled trial, consistent negative evidence from well-designed controlled trials using small samples, or guidelines developed from evidence and supported by expert opinion

**Not Recommended for Practice**

Interventions for which lack of effectiveness or harmfulness has been demonstrated by strong evidence from rigorously conducted studies, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews, or interventions where the costs, burden, or harm associated with the intervention exceed anticipated benefit

**Expert Opinion**

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The article has been reviewed by independent peer reviewers to ensure that it is objective and free from bias.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified for each recommendation (see the original guideline document).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * Two systematic reviews of almost 6,000 patients concluded that morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone (Dilaudid®) are effective in managing cancer pain, which included breakthrough cancer pain (BtCP). 
  * In 25 individual studies of transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) products, pain was reduced compared to baseline in all trials. TIRF products were well tolerated and were rarely discontinued because of adverse effects. One trial noted a decrease in anxiety and depression along with the reduction in pain. 



## Potential Harms



In 25 individual studies, transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) products were well tolerated and were rarely discontinued because of adverse effects, except in one study in which 26% of patients reported adverse effects with intranasal fentanyl spray (INFS). The most common adverse effects were dizziness, vomiting, constipation, and somnolence.
