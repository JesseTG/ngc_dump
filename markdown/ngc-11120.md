# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the strength of recommendation ( **Strong** , **Moderate** , **Weak** ) and strength of evidence ( **Strong** , **Moderate** , **Weak** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Clinical Question 


####  Are positive margins associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR)? Can the use of whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) mitigate this increased risk? 


#####  Recommendation: A positive margin, defined as ink on ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), is associated with a significant increase in IBTR; this increased risk is not nullified by the use of WBRT. (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Level of Evidence: Meta-analysis [patient level] of randomized controlled trials [RCTs] [not primary endpoint]; meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; individual RCT; Strength of Evidence: Strong) 


###  Clinical Question 


####  What margin width minimizes the risk of IBTR in patients receiving WBRT? 


#####  Recommendations 


  1. Margins of at least 2 mm are associated with a reduced risk of IBTR relative to narrower negative margin widths in patients receiving WBRT. ( **Strength of Recommendation** : Moderate; **Level of Evidence** : Meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; **Strength of Evidence** : Moderate) 
  2. The routine practice of obtaining negative margin widths wider than 2 mm is not supported by the evidence. ( **Strength of Recommendation** : Strong; **Level of Evidence** : Meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; **Strength of Evidence** : Strong) 




###  Clinical Question 


####  Is treatment with excision alone and widely clear margins equivalent to treatment with excision and WBRT? 


#####  Recommendation: Treatment with excision alone, regardless of margin width, is associated with substantially higher rates of IBTR than treatment with excision and WBRT (even in predefined low-risk patients). (Strength of Recommendation: Strong; Level of Evidence: Meta-analysis [patient level] of RCTs; individual RCT; Strength of Evidence: Strong) 


###  Clinical Question 


####  What is the optimal margin width for patients treated with excision alone? 


#####  Recommendation: The optimal margin width for treatment with excision alone is unknown, but should be at least 2 mm. Some evidence suggests lower rates of IBTR with margin widths wider than 2 mm. (Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; Level of Evidence: Meta-analysis [study level] of observational studies; prospective single-arm studies; retrospective studies; Strength of Evidence: Moderate) 


###  Clinical Question 


####  What are the effects of endocrine therapy on IBTR? Is the benefit of endocrine therapy associated with negative margin width? 


#####  Recommendation: Rates of IBTR are reduced with endocrine therapy, but there is no evidence of an association between endocrine therapy and negative margin width. (Strength of Recommendation: Weak; Level of Evidence: RCTs; Strength of Evidence: Weak) 


###  Clinical Question 


####  Should margin widths greater than 2 mm be considered in the presence of unfavorable factors such as comedo necrosis, high grade, large size of DCIS, young patient age, negative estrogen receptor (ER) status, or high risk multigene panel scores? 


#####  Recommendation: Multiple factors have been shown to be associated with the risk of IBTR in patients treated with and without WBRT, but there are no data addressing whether margin widths should be influenced by these factors. (Strength of Recommendation: Weak; Level of Evidence: Expert opinion; Strength of Evidence: Weak) 


###  Clinical Question 


####  Should margin width be taken into consideration when determining WBRT delivery technique? 


#####  Recommendation: Choice of WBRT delivery technique, fractionation, and boost dose should not be dependent upon negative margin width. There is insufficient evidence to address optimal margin widths for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). (Strength of Recommendation: Weak; Level of Evidence: Retrospective studies; expert opinion; Strength of Evidence: Weak) 


###  Clinical Question 


####  Should DCIS with microinvasion be considered as invasive carcinoma or DCIS when determining optimal margin width? 


#####  Recommendation: DCIS with microinvasion, defined as no invasive focus >1 mm in size, should be considered as DCIS when considering the optimal margin width. (Strength of Recommendation: Weak; Level of Evidence: Expert opinion; Strength of Evidence: Weak)

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The methods are described in full in the meta-analysis companion to this guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and are summarized briefly below.

**Data Extraction**

Two investigators independently extracted data; disagreements were arbitrated by a third investigator.

**Meta-Analysis**

Analysis was performed using two different statistical approaches. In the frequentist approach, multiple margin cut points within studies, if reported, were condensed into a single cut point, while the Bayesian approach allowed for the use of multiple cut points. All reported odds ratio (ORs) were adjusted for study-specific median follow up time (to account for the inherent increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence [IBTR] with longer follow up) and are reported relative to positive (or positive/close) margins, or to a minimal negative margin (no ink on tumor or margin >1 mm).

**Statistical Analysis**

**Frequentist Models (Random Effects Logistic Meta-regression)**

Margins were dichotomised into positive/close versus negative margin status using one distance threshold per study (>0 or 1 mm; 2 mm; 3 or 5 mm; 10 mm). The association between local recurrence (LR) and margin status and distance was modeled using random effects logistic meta-regression. ORs are presented for negative relative to positive/close margins, and threshold distances relative to >0 or 1 mm.

**Bayesian Models (Network Meta-analysis)**

Network meta-analysis using mixed treatment comparisons used data from single or multiple thresholds within studies (when presented) to compare directly (within study) and indirectly (between studies) the probability of LR between margins categories (positive; >0 or 1 mm; 2 mm; 3 mm; 10 mm). ORs compare negative versus positive margins, and distance categories relative to positive margins.

**Assessment of Covariates**

All models were adjusted for study-level follow up time. Other covariates were assessed for their effect on model estimates (age; median year of recruitment; proportion of patients who received endocrine therapy; proportion with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); proportion of patients receiving whole breast radiation).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened a multidisciplinary margins panel (MP) to evaluate ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) in relation to margin width. The primary question addressed was "what margin width minimizes the risk of IBTR in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) receiving breast-conserving surgery?"

Committee members were chosen by their respective organizations based upon interest and expertise in DCIS management. Processes recommended in the Institute of Medicine report "Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust" which were followed as part of the guideline development process included: (1) the development of a systematic review/study-level meta-analysis based on questions to be addressed by the MP to serve as the primary evidence base, with additional topic-specific literature reviews conducted by participants for questions not addressed in the meta-analysis; (2) the provision for each recommendation of a rating of the strength of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation; (3) the ascertainment of the level of agreement of panel members with each recommendation by vote, and the revision of recommendations to achieve greater than 90% consensus; and (4) the declaration by MP candidates of potential conflicts of interest before convening, and the obtaining of written disclosures at the consensus meeting.

The MP convened in November 2015; the resulting manuscript was approved by all panel members.

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The margins panel (MP) convened in November 2015; the resulting manuscript was approved by all panel members and externally reviewed, and feedback was incorporated. The final manuscript was approved by the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) Executive Council, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Board of Directors, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Board of Directors, and endorsed by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Breast Surgeons.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field). All publications in the meta-analysis (except for two) were retrospective and provided observational data at the study level.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



The use of a 2 mm margin as the standard for an adequate margin in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) is associated with low rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and has the potential to decrease re-excision rates, improve cosmetic outcome, and decrease health care costs.

## Potential Harms

The information herein should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an "as is" basis and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information, or for any errors or omissions. 
  * There are limitations to this guideline. It applies to patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M) treated with whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT). The findings should not be extrapolated to DCIS patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or those with invasive carcinoma for whom a separate guideline has been developed. While studies including patients treated with and without WBRT were included in the meta-analysis, a meta-analysis of studies of treatment with excision alone was not conducted. Additionally, all of the studies included in the meta-analysis were retrospective. However, in the absence of any planned prospective randomized trials addressing the question of margin width and local recurrence, these studies represent the best available evidence for clinical decision making.
