# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Guideline Search Strategy**

**Structured Web site Search**

A member of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines. 

Guidelines were selected based on the following criteria:

  * Self-identified as a "guideline" â€“ in title or body of article 
  * Published in English; national and international in scope 
  * Developed between the years of 2005 - 2014 
  * Strictly on the topic areas listed in search terms 
  * Available and accessible for retrieval 



See the search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a list of Web sites searched.

**Hand Search**

RNAO Expert Panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify and submit potentially relevant guidelines. Guidelines submitted for consideration by panel members were integrated into the retrieved list of guidelines if they had not been identified by the on-line guideline search and met the inclusion criteria.

Concurrent with the review of existing guidelines, a systematic review for recent literature relevant to the scope of the guideline was conducted by a health sciences librarian. 

**Guideline Review**

The RNAO guideline development team searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between 2005 and 2014. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites, recommendations from the literature, and key Web sites related to substance use disorder. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and inclusion criteria, is available online at [www.RNAO.ca](http://www.RNAO.ca "RNAO Web site"). Guidelines were also identified by members of the RNAO expert panel. 

Members of the expert panel critically appraised 14 international guidelines using the _Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II_. From this review, five guidelines were selected to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence. 

**Systematic Review Search Strategy**

A comprehensive search strategy was developed by the RNAO guideline development team in collaboration with the RNAO research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant articles published in English, between 2005 and 2014, was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA). In addition to this systematic search, panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key articles not found through the above search strategies. 

Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as search terms, is available online at <http://rnao.ca/substanceuse>. 

## Number of Source Documents



5 guidelines and 74 studies were included. See the flow diagrams in Appendix D in the original guideline document for more information on the review process.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Guideline Review**

Members of the expert panel critically appraised 14 international guidelines using the _Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II_. From this review, five guidelines were selected to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence. 

**Systematic Review**

Once articles were retrieved, the records were divided equally between two teams of research associates (RA), comprised of two RAs each (three RAs are nurses holding masters degrees; one RA is an epidemiologist holding a masters degree). Each member of the team independently assessed the eligibility of their studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) Best Practice Guideline program manager, who was involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel, resolved disagreements between RAs within each team. 

Quality appraisal scores for 24 articles (a random sample of 10% of articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by each RA. Acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic, Îº=0.71) justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction by dividing the remaining studies equally between the RAs. A final summary of literature findings was completed. The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all RNAO expert panel members for review and discussion. 

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



For this new guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence, which captured relevant literature published between 2005 and 2014, was based on the purpose and scope of this guideline and supported by the following three questions:

  1. What are the most effective methods of assessment for substance use disorders for individuals aged 11 years and older? 
  2. What are the most effective interventions for individuals aged 11 years and older with a substance use disorder? 
  3. What education and policy considerations may best facilitate nurses' care of individuals with a substance use disorder? 



The RNAO expert panel's mandate was to develop an evidence-based Best Practice Guideline that will provide nurses and other health-care providers with current best practices for engaging clients who use substances. The recommendations in this Guideline aim to bridge the identified gap between current practice and evidence-based practice. 

This edition (2015) is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence into the recommendations and provide supporting evidence.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * Administering standardized screening instruments in a variety of practice settings (e.g., emergency departments, primary health-care settings, acute care settings, long-term care) has been shown to reduce substance use among clients; improve access to early interventions, thereby decreasing harms to clients' health and leading to positive client outcomes; and reduce health-care costs to the system. 
  * The evidence suggests that even one short episode of brief intervention (BI) is efficacious in improving outcomes. BI is effective in motivating clients to change and encouraging those with more severe problems to consider referrals to specialized intervention services. It has been shown to decrease alcohol intake, risky drinking practices, and injury frequency. 
  * Benefits of improved collaboration and coordination across the system will include a reduction in avoidable visits to emergency rooms and hospitalizations, reduced wait times for community- and hospital-based services, and improved access to community supports, helping to address the needs of clients in a more timely manner. 
  * See Appendix K in the original guideline document for benefits of psychosocial interventions. 



## Potential Harms

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * These guidelines are not binding on nurses or the organizations that employ them. The use of these guidelines should be flexible, and based on individual needs and local circumstances. They neither constitute a liability nor discharge from liability. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents at the time of publication, neither the authors nor the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) gives any guarantee as to the accuracy of the information contained in them or accepts any liability, with respect to loss, damage, injury, or expense arising from any such errors or omissions in the contents of this work. 
  * This nursing Best Practice Guideline (BPG) is a comprehensive document that provides resources for evidence-based nursing practice. It is not intended to be a manual or "how to" guide, but rather a tool to guide best practices and enhance decision making for nurses working with clients who use substances. The Guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of the individual organizations or practice settings, and the needs and preferences of the client. In addition, the Guideline provides an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. 
  * Nurses, other health-care providers, and administrators who lead and facilitate practice changes will find this document invaluable for developing policies, procedures, protocols, educational programs and assessments, interventions, and documentation tools. Nurses and other health-care providers in direct care will benefit from reviewing the recommendations and the evidence that supports them. It is recommended that practice settings adapt these guidelines in formats that are user-friendly for daily use. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



**Implementation Strategies**

Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO) _Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines_ (2nd ed.) provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see Appendix N in the original guideline document). 

_The Toolkit_ is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health-care is more likely when:

  * Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation 
  * Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process 
  * Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation 
  * Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed 
  * The guideline is tailored to the local context 
  * Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed 
  * Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected 
  * Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained 
  * Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process 
  * There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation 



_The Toolkit_ uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings. 

RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of their Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies including: 1) the Nursing Best Practice Champion NetworkÂ®, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs; 2) nursing order sets which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments; and 3) the Best Practice Spotlight OrganizationÂ® (BPSOÂ®) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. In addition, RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific guidelines and their implementation annually.
