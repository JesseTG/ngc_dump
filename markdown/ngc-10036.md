####  Indications for Aortic Valve Surgery 


#####  Aortic Stenosis (AS) 


######  Class I 


  1. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is recommended in patients with severe AS at the onset of symptoms of dyspnea, angina, or lightheadedness or syncope (see Fig. 1 in the original guideline document) (Ross  & Braunwald, 1968; Schwarz et al., 1982; Sprigings & Forfar, 1995; Horstkotte & Loogen, 1988; Iivanainen et al., 1996; Kelly et al., 1988; Pellikka et al., 2005; Frank, Johnson, & Ross, 1973; Bach et al., 2009). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  2. AVR is recommended, regardless of symptoms, with the identification of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF]  <50%). ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  3. AVR is recommended in patients with severe AS who are scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), surgery on other cardiac valves, or surgery on the aortic root or ascending aorta. ( **Level of evidence C** )

######  Class IIb 


  1. Exercise testing in asymptomatic patients with AS to determine the need for AVR may be considered to elicit exercise-induced symptoms and abnormal blood pressure responses (Alborino et al., 2002; Amato et al., 2001; Das, Rimington,  & Chambers, 2005). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  2. AVR may be considered for asymptomatic patients with severe AS and abnormal response to exercise (e.g., asymptomatic hypotension). ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  3. AVR may be considered for adults with severe asymptomatic AS if there is a high likelihood of rapid progression (age, calcification, and coronary artery disease [CAD]) or if surgery might be delayed at the time of symptom onset. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  4. AVR may be considered in patients undergoing CABG who have mild AS when there is evidence, such as moderate to severe valve calcification, that progression may be rapid. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  5. AVR may be considered for asymptomatic patients with extremely severe AS (aortic valve area [AVA]  <0.6 cm  2  , mean gradient >60 mm Hg, and jet velocity >5.0 m/s) when the patient's expected operative mortality is less than 1%. ( **Level of evidence C** )

  2. Homograft replacement of the aortic valve can be considered for patients undergoing reoperative aortic root surgery in whom anatomic or physiologic constraints mitigate against more conventional composite graft replacement or for whom life expectancy is less than the projected durability of the homograft (Avierinos et al., 2007; Hagl et al., 2002; Moon et al., 2001). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 




######  Class III 


  1. Homografts are not recommended for routine AVR. Currently available xenografts have excellent hemodynamics, durability comparable to homografts and are simpler to replace (El-Hamamsy et al., 2010; O'Brien et al., 2001; Smedira et al., 2006). ( **Level of evidence B** )

  2. BAV should be considered for patients with contraindications to AVR who can potentially be bridged to AVR or TAVR in future. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  3. BAV should be considered in severely symptomatic patients with multiple comorbidities where contribution of AS to symptomatology such as chronic pulmonary disease or poor LV function, remains unclear. ( **Level of evidence C** )

( **Level of evidence A** ) 
  5. TAVR should be performed in a hybrid operating or catheterization room dedicated to the procedure and not with mobile c-arms (Leon et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011). ( **Level of evidence B** )

###  Aortic Valve Leaflet Remodeling, Reimplantation, and Repair 


####  Remodeling 


######  Class I 


  1. Aortic valve repairs should be checked by intraoperative TEE after the repairs is completed. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  2. Patients should be followed postoperatively by yearly echocardiograms after aortic valve repair. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 




######  Class IIa 


  1. Root remodeling may be considered for patients with significantly dilated roots and bicuspid valves or patients with acute aortic dissection, including excision of the non-coronary sinus as a remodeling procedure, also known as the Wolfe procedure. ( **Level of evidence C** )

####  Reimplantation 


######  Class I 


  1. Root size, particularly at the sinuses of Valsalva should be measured by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the external diameter at its greatest extent.

  2. Intraoperative TEE is recommended to check the repair. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  3. Reimplantation is recommended for young patients, when feasible, who have aortic root dilation, with or without regurgitation, and a tricuspid aortic valve. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  4. An aortic root greater than 5.0 cm is recommended as a threshold for prophylactic repair for most patients, including patients with Marfan syndrome. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  5. In patient with a family history of aortic dissection and Marfan syndrome, surgery is recommended at a size of 4.5 cm in cross-sectional diameter. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  6. Gram-positive and gram-negative prophylactic antibiotics should be administered at the time of surgery. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  7. The patient should have yearly echocardiograms. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  8. Prophylactic antibiotics for any invasive procedure including dentistry are recommended. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 




######  Class IIa 


  1. For patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a threshold of 4.2 cm maybe considered for surgery. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  2. The cross-sectional area of the root in square centimeters divided by the patient's height in meters and exceeding 10 may be considered an indication for surgery. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  3. In female patients with a connective tissue disorder who are considering pregnancy, a prophylactic repair may be considered when the aortic root exceeds 4.0 cm. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  4. An antiplatelet agent should be considered postoperatively. ( **Level of evidence C** )

######  Class I 


  1. All patients undergoing bicuspid repair should undergo intraoperative TEE. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  2. Prophylactic antibiotics including both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage should be used for patients undergoing bicuspid valve repair. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  3. Postoperative beta-blockers should be considered after bicuspid valve repairs. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  4. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy should be considered in patients with low EF postoperatively. ( **Level of evidence C** )

###  Management of Acute Aortic Root and Ascending Aortic Dissection 


######  Class I

  2. Ascending aortic replacement (including resection of primary aortic tear) should be performed for patients with acute type A aortic dissection (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  3. An open distal anastomotic, hemiarch or total arch replacement technique is effective for the distal reconstruction of an acute type A dissection (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  4. Ascending aortic and aortic arch replacement is indicated for patients with acute type A aortic dissection and a primary or secondary tear within the arch that involves or extends beyond the left common carotid arterial ostium with marked dilation of the aortic arch ( >50 mm). ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  5. Aortic root replacement is indicated for patients with acute type A aortic dissection and a primary tear that extends or originates in the left or right coronary sinuses or marked dilation ( >45 mm) of the aortic root below the sinotubular junction. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  6. Arterial inflow cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass during type A dissection repair should perfuse the true lumen directly. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  7. Long-term radiologic surveillance after aortic dissection with or without surgical reconstruction should be performed at regular intervals of at least every 6 months for the first year and then annually. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  8. Long-term annual echocardiographic surveillance is recommended for patients in whom an aortic valve preserving reconstruction or bioprosthetic valve replacement was performed. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 




######  Class IIa 


  1. It is reasonable to use antegrade brain perfusion (ABP) or retrograde brain perfusion (RBP) with hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) to complete aortic arch reconstructions to reduce neurologic complications (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  2. It is reasonable to utilize either an aortic valve-sparing or valve-replacement strategy when managing acute type A dissection if an acceptably low mortality rate can be achieved (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  3. It is reasonable to treat acute type A intramural hematomas (IMH) with urgent surgical intervention (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  4. Use of intraoperative TEE is encouraged (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  5. Postoperative, lifelong cross-sectional radiologic surveillance is reasonable in patients with residual aortic dissecting beyond the replaced aortic segment. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 




######  Class IIb 


  1. Medical management and longitudinal surveillance may be considered to treat high-risk patients with asymptomatic, radiologically stable type A IMH. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  2. Medical management and longitudinal surveillance may be considered in patients with type B dissections involving the aortic arch. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  3. Annual echocardiography may be considered in type A aortic dissection patients in whom the aortic valve was resuspended, preserved or replaced with a bioprosthesis. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 




###  Ascending Aorta and Aortic Arch 


######  Class I 


  1. All patients with suspected thoracic aortic disease on the basis of family history, symptoms, or physical examination should have the entire thoracic aorta imaged. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  2. All patients with a bicuspid aortic valve should undergo imaging of the thoracic aorta (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  3. All patients with Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome or mutations associated with aortic disease or dissection should have the entire aorta imaged and appropriate blood testing performed for genetic mutations (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  4. First-degree relatives of young patients with a bicuspid aortic valve or genetic mutation associated aortic disease of the thoracic aortic disease should be advised to be further investigated. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  5. All patients for whom planned elective valvular surgery is planned and who have associated thoracic aortic disease should undergo preoperative cardiac catheterization (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  6. Additional testing to quantitate a patient's comorbid status and develop a risk profile is recommended. These tests may include for particularly high-risk patients CT of the chest if not already done, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 24-hour Holter monitoring, noninvasive carotid screening, brain imaging, echocardiography, neurocognitive testing, and assessment of degree of frailty. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  7. Intraoperative TEE is recommended for all patients undergoing surgery for thoracic aortic disease. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  8. Surgical repair is recommended when the ascending aorta or aortic root exceeds 5.5 cm if the patient has no genetically based aortic disease and is otherwise a suitable candidate for surgery (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  9. Patients with genetically associated aortic diseases, including those with a bicuspid aortic valve, should undergo surgery at diameters exceeding 5.0 cm unless a family history of aortic dissection is present, then it is acceptable to lower the threshold to 4.5 cm. Alternatively, patients with a maximal ascending aortic area (pi r  2  , cm  2  ) to height in meters ratio exceeding 10 should be considered for surgery (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  10. Patients with a growth rate exceeding 0.5 cm per year should be recommended to undergo surgery if no other limitations apply (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  11. For patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome or confirmed TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutation should be evaluated for repair of the aorta when the diameter exceeds 4.2 cm. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  12. For patients undergoing cardiac surgery other than for aortic indications, aortic repair is recommended when diameter exceeds 4.5 cm (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  13. Aortic diameters should be measured at right angles to the axis of flow, which requires the use of three dimensional reconstructive software. The maximal diameters at each segment of the aorta should be reported. Echocardiography measures internal diameters while CT and MRI measures external diameters, and thus some allowance should be made for echocardiographic measurements being smaller. ( **Level of evidence C** ) 
  14. Separate valve and ascending aortic replacement are recommended for patients without significant aortic root dilation, for elderly patients, and for young patients with minimal dilation in whom a biological valve is being inserted or a bicuspid valve is being repaired (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  15. Patients with Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and root dilation should undergo excision of the sinuses in combination with a modified David valve reimplantation procedure if technically feasible or insertion of a valve graft conduit (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 
  16. For more complicated arch reconstructions requiring extended periods of circulatory arrest, use of adjunctive brain perfusion techniques is recommended (Hiratzka et al., 2010). ( **Level of evidence B** ) 




######  Class IIa 


  1. Regular echocardiography and MRI or CT evaluation after repair of thoracic aortic disease is reasonable. ( **Level of evidence C** )

*Data available from clinical trials or registries about the usefulness/efficacy in different subpopulations, such as gender, age, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, and prior aspirin use. A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Although randomized trials are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective.

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



For this systematic review on the Aortic Valve and Ascending Aorta, specific search terms were identified and targeted searches were run in PubMed/MEDLINE in December 2011. The inclusion criteria for the literature search were limited to English language publications, and adult human subjects. The task force augmented the computerized literature search by manually reviewing the reference lists of identified studies and relevant reviews known to the expert committee. In addition, the writing group identified articles from personal files and undertook their own searches for assigned topics. The terms used included aorta, aortic valve, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, bicuspid aortic valve, transcatheter valve, and guidelines.

<p class="Note">*Data available from clinical trials or registries about the usefulness/efficacy in different subpopulations, such as gender, age, history of diabetes, history of prior myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, and prior aspirin use. A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Although randomized trials are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective.</p></div>

Not stated

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



A task force was assembled with the goal of addressing the more technical aspects of aortic and aortic valve surgery. Section authors drafted their recommendations, using prior published guidelines as a reference when available, and circulated to the entire writing committee as drafts. Revisions were made until consensus was reached on class, level of evidence, references, and language.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



See the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field, above.

## Cost Analysis



The original guideline document contains detailed cost analyses (e.g., devices and cost of care) within the recommendations sections.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The full document was submitted for approval by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Workforce on Evidence Based Surgery before publication. The guidelines were posted on the STS website for an open comment period. The guidelines then were also submitted to the STS Council on Quality, Research, and Patient Safety Operating Board and the STS Executive Committee before submission for publication.

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

The guidelines rely primarily on nonrandomized trials, observational studies, registries, propensity analyses, and consensus statements of experts. When needed, the guidelines draw heavily from the previously published 2010 ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * Appropriate evaluation and management of aortic valve and ascending aorta disease 
  * Better understanding of the pros and cons of current surgical treatment options 



## Potential Harms


  * Risks of procedures include risk of systemic emboli necessitating anticoagulation of a thrombogenic heart valve replacement device with its attendant risks of hemorrhage, catastrophic prosthesis failure, prosthetic valve endocarditis, hemolysis from periprosthetic regurgitation, stroke, paraplegia, and death early after a procedure. 
  * Exercise testing should not be performed in symptomatic patients owing to a high risk of complications. 



Refer to the "Cons" sections of the original guideline document for harms and/or disadvantages of specific interventions.

# Contraindications

## Contraindications



  * Temporary contraindications to valve replacement include sepsis, severe debilitation, acute neurological event, coagulopathy, congestive heart failure, and ventilator dependence, etc. 
  * Anatomic factors such as true porcelain aorta, which would be a contraindication to conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR), are amenable to a transapical approach. 
  * Contraindications for the transapical procedure include calcification of the pericardium or left ventricular (LV) apex, patch repair of the apex secondary to an aneurysmectomy, LV apex thrombus, or severe respiratory insufficiency that would be exacerbated by a thoracotomy. Additionally, certain anatomic abnormalities that preclude accessing the LV apex, such as extreme rotation of the heart or previous pneumonectomy resulting in dislocation of the heart into either the right or left chest, rule out a transapical approach. 
  * Contraindications for the direct aortic procedure include atheroma or calcification of the ascending aorta that the surgeon believes precludes placement and safe closure of the aorta. Additionally, certain factors may preclude a direct aortic approach such as anatomic displacement of the aorta (pneumonectomy). 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines are intended to assist physicians and other health care providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis, management, or prevention of specific diseases or conditions. These guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the same results. Moreover, these guidelines are subject to change over time, without notice. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the physician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient. 
  * These guidelines have summarized the current knowledge in the treatment of aortic valve and aortic disease. Clearly there are many questions and these can only partially be answered from incomplete data sets. Undoubtedly, newer iterations will update these guidelines. The choice of the best procedure or valve for patients is dependent on many factors and no procedure or device is ideal. Ultimately it is up to the patient, the cardiologist, and surgeon to reach a decision on appropriate treatment.
