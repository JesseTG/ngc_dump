# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The levels of recommendation ( **1-3** ) and the data quality classifications ( **I-IV** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Ocular Only Versus Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (MG) 


####  Ocular MG 


Nurses should monitor the results of the ice pack test with consideration for its limited value in the diagnosis of MG ( **Level 2** ). 


###  Diagnostic Tests 


####  Laboratory Tests 


Nurses should know the adverse events associated with diagnostic testing in MG and how to manage those side effects as needed. Nurses should monitor for results and adverse events associated with the use of edrophonium for diagnostic testing in MG and manage adverse events appropriately ( **Level 2** ). 


####  Electrodiagnostic Testing 


Nurses should be familiar with electrodiagnostic testing in MG. Nurses should prepare patients for their experience, including the likelihood of some discomfort ( **Level 2** ). 


####  Other 


Nurses should understand and explain the "ice pack test" and diagnostic imaging to the patient and family to lessen fear and anxiety and elicit cooperation and participation ( **Level 2** ). 


###  Nursing Assessment of the Patient with MG 


####  Assessment Techniques 


Nurses should perform a comprehensive nursing assessment of the patient with MG that includes a detailed medical history and symptom description. Nurses should test all voluntary muscles for both muscle strength and fatigability to determine the severity of specific muscle weakness, the degree of functional impairment, and potential complications (see Table 4 in original guideline document) ( **Level 3** ). 


####  Respiratory Muscles 


Nurses should perform a detailed physical assessment of respiratory status ( **Level 3** ). 


Nurses should assess the respiratory system appropriately and support respirations as needed until additional interventions are available ( **Level 3** ). 


###  Treatment 


####  Pharmacological Management 


Nurses must administer and teach the patient with MG and their family to administer the correct dose of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors on time ( **Level 2** ). Nurses must also teach the patient and their family the signs and symptoms of overdose and adverse events ( **Level 2** ). 


Nurses should advise patients who are taking corticosteroids to be aware of infection risk, practice good hand hygiene practices, and avoid exposure to people with infection ( **Level 2** ). 


Nurses should monitor for side effects associated with immunosuppressants and minimize patient risk for infection by maintaining appropriate infection-control practices, including good hand hygiene and sterile technique for invasive procedures ( **Level 2** ). Nurses should administer antimicrobials as prescribed ( **Level 2** ). 


Nurses should monitor for signs and symptoms of adverse effects associated with all medications used in the management of MG as previously described, including those most commonly associated with long-term immunosuppressants/ immunomodulating agents, specifically, infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and skin cancer ( **Level 3** ). 


####  Other Therapies 


#####  Plasmapheresis (Therapeutic Plasma Exchange [TPE]) 


Nurses should monitor for improvement following plasmapheresis ( **Level 2** ). 


Nurses should monitor for complications associated with venous access ( **Level 2** ). 


Nurses should monitor for side effects associated with plasmapheresis including fatigue and hypotension ( **Level 2** ). 


#####  Intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIG) Infusions 


Nurses must understand the rationale for the use of IVIG in the management of MG and its reported benefits and limitations ( **Level 2** ). Nurses must be knowledgeable of different brands of IVIG and institution-specific protocols regarding dosage and rates, which may include a test dose and then a gradual increase in rate as tolerated to lessen risk for adverse effects. Action plans for adverse effects must be followed ( **Level 2** ). 


#####  Thymectomy 


In collaboration with the multidisciplinary team, nurses should educate the patient and family regarding indications, pre- and postoperative care, and prognosis for patients undergoing thymectomy ( **Level 3** ). Following thymectomy, nurses should monitor the patient closely for complications related to MG and the thymectomy procedure and manage them effectively ( **Level 3** ). 


#####  Postoperative Care After Thymectomy 


Nurses should monitor respiratory status, including rate, depth, work of breathing, breath sounds, oxygenation, and ventilation tolerance. Spontaneous breathing trials, pulmonary function studies, forced vital capacity (FVC), and negative inspiratory force (NIF) should be ordered as available ( **Level 3** ). 


Nurses must administer MG medications postoperatively as prescribed. Nurses should balance the administration of medications that may worsen MG, including opioids, with a comfort level that will allow the patient to breathe with the least amount of effort and discomfort ( **Level 3** ). 


Nurses should follow the manufacturer's direction for the chest tube drainage system and monitor chest tube(s) for patency, underwater seal, evidence of air leak, drainage output, and signs and symptoms of infection. Nurses should monitor for signs and symptoms of increasing pneumothorax or hemothorax ( **Level 3** ). 


Nurses should be aware of patients who have factors that may increase the likelihood of a postoperative MG crisis that could complicate their recovery ( **Level 3** ). 


Nurses should monitor closely for signs and symptoms of infection and minimize a patient's risk for infection by consistently complying with infection-control measures ( **Level 3** ). 


###  MG Crisis 


Nurses should be knowledgeable in the differentiation of the two different types of MG crises, myasthenic crisis or cholinergic crisis, and should recognize that both are care priorities. In either situation, nurses should perform a complete respiratory and neuromuscular assessment, which is essential to identify ineffective respiratory function and impaired gag and swallow, and initiate the appropriate airway-management strategies and oxygen delivery ( **Level 3** ) (Vassar et al., 2008). 


Nurses should assess respiratory status, including pulmonary function tests (i.e., NIF and FVC); provide pulmonary hygiene as needed; and alert the licensed independent provider regarding indications for additional respiratory therapy management to minimize respiratory complications, including prolonged ventilation and pneumonia ( **Level 3** ). 


###  General Nursing Management of the Patient With MG 


Nurses should administer drugs that may worsen MG with caution. Review medication profiles with the pharmacist and licensed independent provider ( **Level 3** ). 


Nurses should adopt the previous protocols to facilitate swallowing, avoid aspirations, and optimize nutritional and fluid status ( **Level 3** ). 


Nurses should apply the above strategies in managing fatigue for the patient with MG ( **Level 3** ). 


###  Special Consideration in the Juvenile MG Population 


Nurses should be aware of the teratogenic effects of immunosuppressive medications on the fetus and provide appropriate education to women with MG of childbearing age ( **Level 3** ). 


###  Psychosocial and Educational Needs 


Nurses should educate the patient with MG and their family regarding management of the disease; influence of the disease on lifestyle, swallowing, and chewing impairment; and fatigue and energy conservation ( **Level 3** ). 


###  Definitions: 


####  Data Quality Classification 


**Class I** : Randomized controlled trial (RCT) without significant limitations or meta-analysis 


**Class II** : RCT with important limitations (e.g., methodological flaws or inconsistent results) and observational studies (e.g., cohort or case-control) 


**Class III** : Qualitative study, case study, or series 


**Class IV** : Evidence from expert committee reports and/or expert opinion of the guideline panel, standards of care, and clinical protocols 


####  Levels of Recommendation 


**Level 1** : Recommendations are supported by class I evidence. 


**Level 2** : Recommendations are supported by class II evidence. 


**Level 3** : Recommendations are supported by class III and IV evidence.

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



A review of literature published between January 2000 and September 2012 was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE and CINAHL databases with the following search terms: myasthenia gravis, neuromuscular junction (NMJ), neuromuscular transmission, thymectomy, evidence-based practice nursing, research, and myasthenia gravis clinical trials. The search was extended to earlier years because of the lack of more recent references on select topics. Several publications dated earlier than 2000 are included because of their historical clinical significance.

The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America guidelines were assessed and incorporated in this document as appropriate and needed.
