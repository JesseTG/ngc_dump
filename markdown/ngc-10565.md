## Guideline Status



This is the current release of the guideline.

This guideline meets NGC's 2013 (revised) inclusion criteria.

# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions of the levels of the recommendations ( **A, B, C, U, R** ) and classification of the evidence ( **Class I-IV** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


**Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)** : Refer to the LGMD Guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for the clinical context of the recommendations. 


###  Major Practice Recommendations 


The recommendations below encompass three major areas: diagnosis, evaluation, and management of muscular dystrophies. The full recommendation set is available online. 


####  Diagnosis of Muscular Dystrophies 


For patients with suspected muscular dystrophy, clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide genetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement, inheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (e.g., early contractures, cardiac or respiratory involvement) ( **Level B** ). 


In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of targeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to identify the genetic abnormality ( **Level C** ). 


####  Evaluation and Medical Management of Muscular Dystrophies 


#####  Cardiac Involvement 


Clinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A, LGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C–K, LGMD2M–P, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), and myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) or (2) muscular dystrophy without a specific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural evaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management ( **Level B** ). 


If ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (e.g., echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has episodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (e.g., Holter monitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management ( **Level B** ). 


Clinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic tachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation ( **Level B** ). 


It is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L for cardiac evaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms ( **Level B** ). 


#####  Dysphagia and Nutrition 


Clinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with dysphagia, frequent aspiration, or weight loss for swallowing evaluation or gastroenterology evaluation to assess and manage swallowing function and aspiration risk, to teach patients techniques for safe and effective swallowing (e.g., chin tuck maneuver, altered food consistencies), and to consider placement of a gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube for nutritional support ( **Level B** ). 


#####  Pulmonary Complications 


Clinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat respiratory insufficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop pulmonary symptoms later in their course ( **Level B** ). 


In patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (e.g., those with LGMD2I or MFM), clinicians should obtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the upright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and treat respiratory insufficiency ( **Level B** ). 


It is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L for pulmonary evaluation unless they are symptomatic ( **Level C** ). 


Clinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative sleep (e.g., frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory insufficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for consideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life ( **Level B** ). 


#####  Spinal Deformities 


Clinicians should monitor patients with muscular dystrophy for the development of spinal deformities to prevent resultant complications and preserve function ( **Level B** ). 


Clinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with musculoskeletal spine deformities to an orthopedic spine surgeon for monitoring and surgical intervention if it is deemed necessary in order to maintain normal posture, assist mobility, maintain cardiopulmonary function, and optimize quality of life ( **Level B** ). 


####  Rehabilitative Management and Treatment of Muscular Dystrophies 


#####  Clinical Rehabilitative Management 


Clinicians should refer patients with muscular dystrophy to a clinic that has access to multiple specialties (e.g., physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, speech and swallowing therapy, cardiology, pulmonology, orthopedics, and genetics) designed specifically to care for patients with muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular disorders in order to provide efficient and effective long-term care ( **Level B** ). 


Clinicians should recommend that patients with muscular dystrophy have periodic assessments by a physical and occupational therapist for symptomatic and preventive screening ( **Level B** ). 


While respecting and protecting patient autonomy, clinicians should proactively anticipate and facilitate patient and family decision-making as the disease progresses, including decisions regarding loss of mobility, need for assistance with activities of daily living, medical complications, and end-of-life care ( **Level B** ). 


For patients with muscular dystrophy, clinicians should prescribe physical and occupational therapy, as well as bracing and assistive devices that are adapted specifically to the patient's deficiencies and contractures, in order to preserve mobility and function and prevent contractures ( **Level B** ). 


#####  Strength Training and Aerobic Exercise Training 


Clinicians may advise patients with muscular dystrophy that aerobic exercise combined with a supervised submaximal strength training program is probably safe ( **Level C** ). 


Clinicians may advise patients with muscular dystrophy that gentle, low-impact aerobic exercise (swimming, stationary bicycling) improves cardiovascular performance, increases muscle efficiency, and lessens fatigue ( **Level C** ). 


Clinicians may counsel patients with muscular dystrophy to hydrate adequately, not to exercise to exhaustion, and to avoid supramaximal, high-intensity exercise ( **Level C** ). 


Clinicians should educate patients with muscular dystrophy who are participating in an exercise program about the warning signs of overwork weakness and myoglobinuria, which include feeling weaker rather than stronger within 30 minutes after exercise, excessive muscle soreness 24–48 hours following exercise, severe muscle cramping, heaviness in the extremities, and prolonged shortness of breath ( **Level B** ). 


#####  Medical Treatments 


Clinicians should not currently offer patients with muscular dystrophy gene therapy, myoblast transplantation, neutralizing antibody to myostatin, or growth hormone outside of a research study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of the treatment ( **Level R** ). 


###  Definitions: 


###  Classification of Evidence Schemes 


####  Screening 


**Class I** : A statistical, population-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. All patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations. 


**Class II** : A statistical, non-referral-clinic-based sample of patients studied at a uniform point in time (usually early) during the course of the condition. Most patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation that is masked to the patients' clinical presentations. 


**Class III** : A sample of patients studied during the course of the condition. Some patients undergo the intervention of interest. The outcome, if not objective, is determined in an evaluation by someone other than the treating physician. 


**Class IV** : Studies not meeting Class I, II or III criteria including consensus, expert opinion or a case report 


####  Therapy 


**Class I** : Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with masked outcome assessment, in a representative population. The following are required: 


  1. Concealed allocation 
  2. Primary outcome(s) clearly defined 
  3. Exclusion/inclusion criteria clearly defined 
  4. Adequate accounting for drop-outs and cross-overs with numbers sufficiently low to have minimal potential for bias 
  5. Relevant baseline characteristics are presented and substantially equivalent among treatment groups or there is appropriate statistical adjustment for differences 




**Class II** : Prospective matched group cohort study in a representative population with masked outcome assessment that meets a-e above OR a RCT in a representative population that lacks one criteria a-d. 


**Class III** : All other controlled trials (including well-defined natural history controls or patients serving as own controls) in a representative population, where outcome is independently assessed, or independently derived by objective outcome measurement. 


**Class IV** : Evidence from uncontrolled studies, case series, case reports, or expert opinion. 


####  Classification of Recommendations 


**Level A** = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)* 


**Level B** = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.) 


**Level C** = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.) 


**Level U** = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven. 


**Level R** = Designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. 


*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome  >5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is >2).

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



In July 2010, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guideline Development Subcommittee and the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine Practice Issues Review Panel (see Appendices e-1-e-3 in the LGMD Guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) formed a panel of neurologists, other physicians with relevant expertise, methodologists, and patient advocates. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched from 1987 onward for relevant peer-reviewed articles in humans and in English only (Appendix e-4 in the LGMD Guideline provides the full search strategy and terms). Through an initial search conducted in 2011 and an updated search conducted in 2013, a total of 3,246 abstracts were identified. Of those, 1,335 articles were selected for full-text review. Two panel members, working independently of each other, reviewed each of the 1,335 articles and selected 699 for final review and classification.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Each final article was reviewed by 2 panel members who rated it according to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2011 criteria for classification of articles (see Appendix e-5 in the LGMD Guideline [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]), using the scheme appropriate to the clinical question. The AAN population screening evidence scheme was used for questions 1–4, and the therapeutic scheme for question 5. Where differences in article ratings occurred, a third panel member determined the ultimate rating.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus (Delphi)

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The systematic review and practice recommendations were developed according to the processes described in the 2004 and 2011 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guideline development process manuals. Appendices e-1 through e-6 in the LGMD Guideline (see "Availability of Companion Documents" field) provide further background on development of this guideline.

To inform recommendations regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs), the authors performed systematic reviews to answer the following questions:

  1. What is the frequency of genetically confirmed LGMD subtypes? 
  2. How often do patients with muscular dystrophy and its specific subtypes have specific clinical features, including ethnic predilection, diagnostic patterns of weakness, respiratory and cardiac complications, laboratory abnormalities (e.g., elevated creatine kinase [CK]), specific patterns on imaging, and muscle biopsy features? 
  3. Are there effective therapies for muscular dystrophies? 



The conclusions from the systematic reviews informed the practice recommendation development process. The author panel developed actionable practice recommendations following an explicit structured process. Levels of obligation associated with each recommendation were assigned using a modified Delphi process.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Classification of Recommendations**

**Level A** = Established as effective, ineffective or harmful (or established as useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level A rating requires at least two consistent Class I studies.)*

**Level B** = Probably effective, ineffective or harmful (or probably useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level B rating requires at least one Class I study or two consistent Class II studies.)

**Level C** = Possibly effective, ineffective or harmful (or possibly useful/predictive or not useful/predictive) for the given condition in the specified population. (Level C rating requires at least one Class II study or two consistent Class III studies.)

**Level U** = Data inadequate or conflicting; given current knowledge, treatment (test, predictor) is unproven.

**Level R** = Designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting.

*In exceptional cases, one convincing Class I study may suffice for an "A" recommendation if 1) all criteria are met, 2) the magnitude of effect is large (relative rate improved outcome >5 and the lower limit of the confidence interval is >2).
