# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the quality of the evidence (++++, +++O, ++OO, and +OOO) and for the strength of the recommendations ("recommends" or "suggests") are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


  1. The Practice Committee recommends endoscopic dilation for patients with dysphagia secondary to benign intrinsic strictures of the esophagus. (++++) 
  2. The Practice Committee recommends wire-guided dilation, preferably under fluoroscopic guidance, or through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilation for complex esophageal strictures. (+++O) 
  3. The Practice Committee recommends antisecretory treatment in conjunction with dilation to reduce the recurrence rate of peptic strictures. (++++) 
  4. The Practice Committee recommends that dilation for adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) be reserved for those who have a dominant esophageal stricture or ring and those who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy. (+++O) 
  5. The Practice Committee suggests adjunctive treatment with corticosteroid injection into recurrent or refractory benign esophageal peptic strictures. (++OO) 
  6. The Practice Committee suggests that esophageal stent placement be reserved for refractory esophageal strictures that do not respond to sequential dilation and/or steroid injection. (++OO) 
  7. The Practice Committee recommends that both endoscopic and surgical treatment options for achalasia be discussed with the patient. In patients who opt for endoscopic management and are good surgical candidates, the Practice Committee recommends pneumatic dilation with large-caliber balloon dilators for the endoscopic treatment of achalasia. (++++) 
  8. The Practice Committee recommends botulinum toxin injection for endoscopic treatment of achalasia in patients who are poor candidates for surgery or pneumatic dilation. (+++O)

####  Recommendation Strength 


The strength of individual recommendations is based on both the aggregate evidence quality and an assessment of the anticipated benefits and harms. Weaker recommendations are indicated by phrases such as "the Practice Committee suggests," whereas stronger recommendations are typically stated as "the Practice Committee recommends."

  * To provide information on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of dysphagia 



## Target Population

## Interventions and Practices Considered



  1. Endoscopic dilation 
  2. Wire-guided dilation or through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilation 
  3. Antisecretory treatment (in conjunction with dilation) 
  4. Adjunctive corticosteroid injection (into recurrent or refractory benign esophageal peptic strictures) 
  5. Esophageal stent placement (for refractory esophageal strictures that do not respond to sequential dilation and/or steroid injection) 
  6. Discussion of endoscopic and surgical treatment options for achalasia with the patient 
  7. Pneumatic dilation with large-caliber balloon dilators for endoscopic treatment of achalasia 
  8. Botulinum toxin injection (for patients who are poor candidates for surgery or pneumatic dilation) 



## Major Outcomes Considered


  * Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diagnostic tests 
  * Success rate of endoscopic procedures 
  * Incidence and severity of complications 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



In preparing this guideline, a search of the medical literature was performed by using PubMed for the period 1990 to 2013. Additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When few or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Not stated

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



Guidelines for appropriate use of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus at the time that the guidelines are drafted.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Recommendation Strength**

The strength of individual recommendations is based on both the aggregate evidence quality and an assessment of the anticipated benefits and harms. Weaker recommendations are indicated by phrases such as "the Practice Committee suggests," whereas stronger recommendations are typically stated as "the Practice Committee recommends."

## Cost Analysis



  * A cost analysis showed that esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with therapeutic intent is more cost-effective than an initial diagnostic approach with barium swallow in patients with histories suggestive of benign esophageal obstruction. 
  * Cost analysis models indicate that initial pneumatic dilation is a more cost-effective approach compared with botulinum toxin injection or laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) for healthy patients with achalasia. 



## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



This document was reviewed and approved by the Governing Board of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate use of endoscopy as an effective tool in the evaluation and management of dysphagia

## Potential Harms



  * Dilation should be performed with caution in patients who have had a recent, healed perforation or upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. 
  * The main adverse events associated with dilation are perforation, bleeding, and aspiration. The perforation rate for esophageal strictures after dilation ranges from 0.1% to 0.4% and is higher with complex strictures and radiation-induced strictures. The perforation rate may be influenced by endoscopist experience. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications



The presence of an esophageal perforation is an absolute contraindication to esophageal dilation.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Guidelines for appropriate use of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus at the time that the guidelines are drafted. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of this guideline. This guideline may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. 
  * This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This guideline is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action. Therefore, clinical considerations may lead an endoscopist to take a course of action that varies from these guidelines.
