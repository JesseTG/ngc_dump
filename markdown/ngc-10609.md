## Guideline Status



This is the current release of the guideline.

This guideline meets NGC's 2013 (revised) inclusion criteria.

# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The strength of recommendation ( **strong** or **weak/conditional** ) and levels of evidence ( **high** , **moderate** , **low** or **very low** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


  1. In adult patients with _Clostridium difficile_ -associated disease (CDAD), the panel strongly recommends that patients undergo surgery early, that is, before the development of shock or the need for vasopressors. This recommendation is based on very low quality evidence but considers that individual patients will place a high value on the overall benefit (reduced mortality rates). 
  2. In adult patients with CDAD undergoing surgery, the panel conditionally recommends total or subtotal colectomy (vs. partial colectomy or other surgery). This recommendation is based on very low-quality evidence but places a high value on patient preferences for a definitive surgical intervention that may more effectively reduce mortality rates.

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Inclusion Criteria for This Review**

**Study Types**

For the purpose of making recommendations, studies included randomized controlled trials, prospective observational or retrospective studies, and case control studies. Meta-analyses, case reports, letters, and reviews containing no original data or comments were excluded.

**Participant Types**

The panel included studies of adult patients without restricting sex, ethnicity, or degree of comorbidity. Only studies pertaining to the treatment of hospitalized patients with _Clostridium difficile_ -associated disease (CDAD) were included. CDAD was defined as severe _Clostridium difficile_ infection (CDI) resulting in clinical deterioration, such as multiorgan system failure, peritonitis, and/or sepsis as a consequence of the disease.

**Intervention Type**

The panel included studies in which total abdominal colectomy (TAC) or subtotal colectomy (each defined as removal of most of the colon excluding the rectum) was performed compared with other procedures such as segmental colectomy, exploratory laparotomy without colectomy, or ostomy formation.

**Outcome Measure Types**

Outcomes were chosen by the team and rated in importance from 1 to 9, with scores of 7 to 9 representing critical outcomes. The following outcomes were considered by the committee members: length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, cost, ventilator-free days, renal failure, and respiratory failure. However, all of these criteria were deemed noncritical for the decision-making process within the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. In addition, the available literature did not provide sufficient or consistent measurements across the studies, specifically if the onset of related conditions such as renal or respiratory failure occurred before or after surgical intervention. Only a reduction in mortality was deemed a critical outcome for the decision-making process, and this was chosen as the primary outcome measure.

**Review Methods**

**Search Strategy**

With the assistance of an information specialist, the panel conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 1992 to January 2014. The search used the following MeSH terms alone or in combination: _Clostridium difficile_ , _colitis_ , _colectomy_ , _surgery_ , and _mortality_. The panel used the "Related Articles" function to broaden the search and scan all citations for relevance. The panel used only articles available in English. In addition to the electronic search, they manually searched the bibliographies of recent reviews and articles.

**Study Selection**

After completing the literature search, two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts; any disagreement on inclusion was resolved through consensus. They excluded case reports and narrative review articles. The resulting studies were subjected to full-text review by two independent reviewers.

**Results**

The original search yielded 62 studies; after the elimination of studies that did not contain the original data, only 38 were deemed appropriate for full-text review. The panel further excluded six studies: one excluded study included a pediatric population, another was descriptive in nature, and four did not address the specific questions outlined in our review.

## Number of Source Documents



32 studies were included in this guideline for recommendation. Of these articles, there were no randomized trials; two were prospective studies, while the remaining were retrospective (see Table 1 in the original guideline document).

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Meta-Analysis
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Data Extraction and Management**

Using a form developed by the team, two independent reviewers extracted data from the individual studies into Microsoft Excel, using double data entry for accuracy. They entered these data into Review Manager X.6 (Review Manager [RevMan][Computer program], Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2012), including information on the authors, study number, country of origin, study methodology, population, intervention, and relevant outcome measures.

**Methodological Quality Assessment**

The articles were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, which describes four levels of quality of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Quality of evidence is reflected as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect is correct and includes an explicit consideration of the following domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. The data were entered into GRADEpro for the generation of evidence tables.

**Measures of Treatment Effect**

The reviews reported the dichotomous outcome of mortality as a risk ratio (RR) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and _p_ values since the baseline incidence of the primary outcome was thought to be relatively high in this population ( >20%). The unit of analysis was individual patients.

**Assessment of Heterogeneity**

Potential heterogeneity exists because of population differences, different types of surgery performed, and how patients are defined. The workgroup examined these differences across studies to assess the clinical and methodological heterogeneity. For the meta-analysis, the reviewers used RevMan to calculate the Q statistic, and then the I2 statistic (%) was used to determine the proportion of variation between studies attributable to heterogeneity and categorized as "low" (25%-49%), "moderate" (50%-74%), or "high" (74%-100%). They also used the _x_ 2 test for heterogeneity and examined the CIs for overlap, with decreasing overlap representing increasing heterogeneity.

**Data Synthesis (Meta-analysis)**

The reviews performed a meta-analysis of the outcome of mortality rate for each population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) question by using the RevMan software. They used the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model method because the included studies did not share a common effect size and unknown influential factors could vary across studies (unknown confounders). This allowed the reviewers to incorporate both the intrastudy and interstudy variability along a distribution of the "true" effects, which weighs larger and smaller studies more evenly. Potential heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the Q statistic, I2 statistic (%), and _x_ 2 test for heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was "moderate" to "high," they did not consider pooling the data; rather, they performed a qualitative narrative summary of the results only.

**Sensitivity Analysis**

The reviews conducted a sensitivity analysis for PICO Question 2 to investigate the implications of the ultimate surgery type performed compared with the first surgery since some patients underwent more than one procedure. A further analysis was performed to examine only those studies that reported their conversion rates from other procedures to total abdominal colectomy (TAC).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



Recommendations are based on the overall quality of evidence with implicit consideration of the risk-benefit ratio and patients' values and preferences. Strong recommendations are prefaced by the statement "the panel strongly recommends," while weak recommendations are prefaced by the statement "the panel suggest" or "the panel conditionally recommend" as per the GRADE methodology (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate management of patients with _Clostridium difficile_ -associated disease (CDAD)

## Potential Harms



Despite the overall quality of evidence being very low, the panel considered that most patients would place a high value on the potential 50% reduction in mortality and that the potential benefit outweighs any potential harm in performing surgery early.

  * "Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment.
