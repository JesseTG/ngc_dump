###  Definitions 


####  Strength of Recommendation 


Recommendation strengths were dichotomized as "strong" or "conditional." Strong recommendations were made when the panel was very confident that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweighed the harms; conditional recommendations were made when the ratio between risks and benefits was more balanced. Per the GRADE formalism, a "strong" recommendation implies that the panelists believe "all or almost all informed people would make the recommended choice for or against an intervention." A "conditional" recommendation implies that "most informed people would choose the recommended course of action, but a substantial number would not." 


####  Quality of Evidence 


  * **High** : The panel is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. 
  * **Moderate** : The panel is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. 
  * **Low** : The panel's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Review**

A systematic review of the literature was performed in early 2015 to form the basis of the guideline. An analytic framework incorporating the population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO) was first used to develop and refine search strategies for each key question (KQ). The searches were conducted in MEDLINE PubMed and designed to identify studies published in English between January 1990 and December 2014 that evaluated adults with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) who were treated with primary radiation therapy (RT), adjuvant RT, or RT with concurrent systemic therapy. Both MeSH terms and text words were utilized and terms common to all searches included: _oropharyngeal neoplasms_ , _carcinoma squamous cell_ , and _radiotherapy_. Additional terms specific to each KQ were also incorporated. The outcomes of interest were overall and progression-free survival, recurrence rates, toxicity, and quality of life. The electronic searches were supplemented by hand searches.

A total of 2615 abstracts were retrieved. The articles were then reviewed by American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) staff, the co-chairs of the guideline, and the writing groups for each KQ. During the first round of screening, 2452 articles were eliminated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were: patients 18 years or older, all stages of oropharyngeal cancer, and publication date 1990 to 2014. Included treatments were: primary RT, primary chemoradiation (CRT), primary surgery with adjuvant RT with or without systemic therapy, or induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by radiation therapy or CRT. The exclusion criteria were: pre-clinical or non-human studies, case reports/series, non-English language, available in abstract only, pediatric patients, distant metastasis, non-squamous cell carcinoma, and otherwise not clinically relevant to the key clinical questions. The panelists on KQ 1, 3 and 4 generally only considered articles in which the percentage of OPSCC patients was greater than 50%; the panelists on KQ2 did not have an absolute threshold because OPSCC patients typically comprise a minority of individuals in post-operative studies.

## Number of Source Documents



Ultimately, 119 full-text articles were chosen for inclusion and abstracted into detailed literature tables to provide supporting evidence for the clinical guideline recommendations.

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The studies were abstracted into detailed literature tables to provide supporting evidence for the clinical guideline recommendations.

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology defines "quality of evidence" as a rating that indicates "the extent of our confidence that the estimates of an effect are adequate to support a particular decision or recommendation." The quality of evidence underlying each recommendation statement was categorized as either high, moderate, low. Although GRADE does provide for a "very low" quality, the panel did not consider this rating for consistency with prior American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines. Refer to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field for a description of each quality level.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus (Delphi)

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Process**

In accordance with established American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) policy, the Guidelines Subcommittee recruited a guideline panel of recognized experts in oropharyngeal cancer, including radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, otolaryngologists, and a patient advocate. Panel members were drawn from academic settings, private practice, and residency. Four specific key questions (KQs) were proposed, which addressed: (KQ1) the addition of concurrent systemic therapy to RT, (KQ2) the delivery of post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) with and without systemic therapy following primary surgery, (KQ3) the use of induction chemotherapy (IC), and (KQ4) the optimal dose-fractionation regimens with and without systemic therapy, as well as nodal volumes for primary tonsillar cancer. In September 2014, the ASTRO Board of Directors approved the proposal and panel membership. 

Through a series of communications by conference calls and emails between December 2014 and February 2016, the guideline panel, with ASTRO staff support, completed the systematic review, created literature tables, and formulated the recommendation statements and narratives for the guideline. The members of the task force were divided into four writing groups by KQs, according to their areas of expertise.

**Grading of Evidence and Recommendations and Consensus Methodology**

Guideline recommendation statements were generated from this literature review, with high-quality evidence forming the basis of the statements whenever possible, in accordance with Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards; expert opinion supplemented the evidence base if high-level data were not available. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed in the construction and assessment of the recommendation statements. GRADE is an explicit, systematic approach to defining the recommendation strength and quality of evidence. 

Recommendation strengths were dichotomized as "strong" or "conditional" (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). "When a recommendation is weak, clinicians and other health care providers need to devote more time to the process of shared decision making by which they ensure that the informed choice reflects individual values and preferences." The importance of patient preferences and shared decision-making was highlighted in each conditional recommendation statement.

The degree of consensus among the panelists on each recommendation statement was evaluated through a modified Delphi approach. A survey was sent by ASTRO staff to the panel members, who rated their agreement with each recommendation on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree (higher score corresponds with stronger agreement). A pre-specified threshold of ≥75% of raters was determined to indicate when consensus was achieved. If a recommendation statement did not meet this threshold, it was modified and re-surveyed, or excluded from the guideline. The final set of recommendation statements were achieved after 2 surveys.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Strength of Recommendation**

Recommendation strengths were dichotomized as "strong" or "conditional." Strong recommendations were made when the panel was very confident that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweighed the harms; conditional recommendations were made when the ratio between risks and benefits was more balanced. Per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) formalism, a "strong" recommendation implies that the panelists believe "all or almost all informed people would make the recommended choice for or against an intervention." A "conditional" recommendation implies that "most informed people would choose the recommended course of action, but a substantial number would not."

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The initial draft of the manuscript was reviewed by three expert reviewers (see the "Acknowledgements" section in the original guideline document) and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) legal counsel. A revised draft was placed on the ASTRO Web site in April 2016 for a six-week period of public comment. Following integration of the feedback, the document was submitted for approval to the ASTRO Board of Directors in September 2016.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of evidence supporting the recommendations is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



The data are consistent that concurrent chemotherapy in combination with radiation therapy (RT) improves locoregional recurrence (LRC) for patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, treated with either conventional or altered fractionation (AltFX). In most of these studies, the reduction in locoregional progression translated into a significant and meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit. Although chemotherapy significantly increased acute toxicities, late effects were comparable to treatment with RT alone, such that the survival benefits of concurrent therapy clearly outweigh the non-trivial but short-term risks. Since the vast majority of the patients in these trials presented with stage IV disease, concurrent systemic therapy should be delivered in this population of patients. 

Refer to the "Narrative" sections in the supplemental material (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for information on benefits found in specific trials.

## Potential Harms



  * While most of the phase III randomized studies found for Key Question 1 show that adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy (RT) improves survival, the combination clearly increased the risk of severe, acute toxicities. Refer to the "Complications" section in the supplemental material (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for additional information. 
  * Xerostomia, a potential side effect to radiation when the salivary glands are damaged, can affect basic functions like chewing, swallowing and breathing; senses such as taste and smell; and can significantly alter the patient's appearance and voice. 
  * The addition of chemotherapy to aggressive altered fractionation (AltFX) approaches must be considered with caution given the potential for increased acute and late effects associated with this approach. 



Refer to the "Narrative" sections in the supplemental material (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for information on toxicity results found in specific trials.

# Contraindications

## Contraindications



  * Cetuximab should not be combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy unless on a clinical trial. 
  * Contraindications to unilateral treatment include significant involvement of soft palate, base of tongue and/or T3 primary size. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * Adherence to this guideline will not ensure successful treatment in every situation. Furthermore, this guideline should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The physician must make the ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific therapy in light of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient. The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) assumes no liability for the information, conclusions, and findings contained in its guidelines. In addition, this guideline cannot be assumed to apply to the use of these interventions performed in the context of clinical trials, given that clinical studies are designed to evaluate or validate innovative approaches in a disease for which improved treatments are needed or are being explored. 
  * The guideline panel recommends that providers discuss with patients' shortly after diagnosis what to expect regarding symptoms, treatment-related toxicities, outcomes including risk of recurrence, and effects of the disease and the treatments on quality of life. 
  * This guideline was prepared on the basis of information available at the time the panel was conducting its research and discussions on this topic. There may be new developments that are not reflected in this guideline and that may, over time, be a basis for ASTRO to consider revisiting and updating the guideline.
