# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the strength of evidence (Class I-III) and strength of recommendations (Level A-C) are repeated at the end of the Major Recommendations. 


  1. **In emergency department (ED) patients with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure, does screening for target organ injury reduce rates of adverse outcomes?**

####  Patient Management Recommendations 

#####  Level A recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level B recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level C recommendations. 

    1. In ED patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure, routine screening for acute target organ injury (e.g., serum creatinine, urinalysis, electrocardiogram [ECG]) is not required. 
    2. In select patient populations (e.g., poor follow-up), screening for an elevated serum creatinine level may identify kidney injury that affects disposition (e.g., hospital admission). 



  2. **In patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure, does ED medical intervention reduce rates of adverse outcomes?**

####  Patient Management Recommendations 

#####  Level A recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level B recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level C recommendations. 

    1. In patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure, routine ED medical intervention is not required. 
    2. In select patient populations (e.g., poor follow-up), emergency physicians may treat markedly elevated blood pressure in the ED and/or initiate therapy for long-term control. [Consensus recommendation] 
    3. Patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure should be referred for outpatient follow-up. [Consensus recommendation]

####  Strength of Recommendations 


**Level A recommendations.** Generally accepted principles for patient management that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on strength of evidence Class I or overwhelming evidence from strength of evidence Class II studies that directly address all of the issues) 


**Level B recommendations.** Recommendations for patient management that may identify a particular strategy or range of management strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on strength of evidence Class II studies that directly address the issue, decision analysis that directly addresses the issue, or strong consensus of strength of evidence Class III studies) 


**Level C recommendations.** Other strategies for patient management that are based on Class III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on panel consensus. In instances in which consensus recommendations are made, this is specifically indicated next to the recommendation. 


There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.

  * Patients with acute presentations of serious medical conditions associated with hypertension such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure 



## Interventions and Practices Considered



  1. Screening for elevated creatinine (as indicated) 
  2. Initiation of treatment to lower blood pressure (as indicated) 
  3. Referral to outpatient follow-up 



## Major Outcomes Considered


  * Adverse effects 
  * Long-term target organ injury
  * Morbidity 
  * Mortality

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least two subcommittee members for strength of evidence. The articles were classified by the subcommittee members into three classes of evidence on the basis of the design of the study, with design 1 representing the strongest design and design 3 representing the weakest design for therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic clinical reports, respectively (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, including but not necessarily limited to randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, external validity, generalizability, and sample size. Articles received a final grade (Class I, II, III) on the basis of a predetermined formula, taking into account the design and study quality (Appendix B in the original guideline document). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were not relevant to the critical question received an "X" grade and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different levels of grading as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific level of evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table included at the end of the original guideline document.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



This policy is a product of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy development process, including expert review, and is based on the existing literature; where literature was not available, consensus of emergency physicians was used.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Clinical findings and strength of recommendations about patient management were then made according to the following criteria:

**Strength of Recommendations**

**Level A recommendations**. Generally accepted principles for patient management that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on strength of evidence Class I or overwhelming evidence from strength of evidence Class II studies that directly address all of the issues).

**Level B recommendations**. Recommendations for patient management that may identify a particular strategy or range of management strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on strength of evidence Class II studies that directly address the issue, decision analysis that directly addresses the issue, or strong consensus of strength of evidence Class III studies).

**Level C recommendations**. Other strategies for patient management that are based on Class III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on panel consensus. In instances in which consensus recommendations are made, this is specifically indicated next to the recommendation.

There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Expert review comments were received from emergency physicians, family physicians, cardiologists, nephrologists, and individual members of the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Heart Association Council for High Blood Pressure Research, the American Society of Nephrology, and the Emergency Nurses Association. Their responses were used to further refine and enhance this policy; however, their responses do not imply endorsement of this clinical policy.

Approved by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Board of Directors, February 6, 2013.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate management of patients with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure in the emergency department (ED)

## Potential Harms



It is generally accepted that the rapid lowering of markedly elevated blood pressure in the asymptomatic patient has the potential to do harm.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the print journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of _Annals of Emergency Medicine_ and its editors. 
  * This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. 
  * It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain enough quality information to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. 
  * Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic and management options that the emergency physician should consider. ACEP clearly recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment. Rather, this guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy.
