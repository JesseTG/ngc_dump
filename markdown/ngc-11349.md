# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases
- Searches of Unpublished Data

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

**Guideline Review**

The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) Best Practice Guideline Program Team's Project Coordinator searched an established list of websites for guidelines and other relevant content published between July 2010 and May 2016. The resulting list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based-practice Web sites and recommendations from the literature. Expert panel members were also asked to suggest additional guidelines. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of Web sites searched and inclusion criteria, is available at <http://rnao.ca/>.

**Systematic Review**

A comprehensive search strategy was developed by RNAO's research team and a health sciences librarian, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. A search for relevant reviews published in English only between January 2011 and May‚ÄìAugust 2016 was applied to the following databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), and EMBASE; Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) was used for question four only. Panel members were asked to review personal libraries for key reviews not found through the above search strategies.

Detailed information on the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria and search terms, is available in the search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). 

Reviews were independently assessed for relevance and eligibility based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria by two RNAO nursing research associates. Any disagreements were resolved through tie-breaking by the guideline development lead.

**Hand Search**

Panel members were asked to review personal libraries to identify key articles not found through the above search strategies. Articles identified by panel members were included in the search results if two nursing research associates independently determined the articles had not been identified by the literature search and met the inclusion criteria. Two (n = 2) articles were submitted, however, no hand search articles for any of the five research questions were included in the final results. 

## Number of Source Documents



Five guidelines and 125 studies were included. See the flow diagrams in Appendix D in the original guideline document for more information on the review process.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Guideline Review**

The guideline development lead and nursing research associates appraised 12 international guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE) II (Brouwers et al., 2010). Guidelines with an overall score of four or below were considered weak and were excluded. Guidelines with a score of five were considered moderate, and guidelines with a score of six or seven were considered strong.

Refer to the original guideline document for a list of the selected guidelines. 

**Systematic Review**

Quality appraisal scores for 40 reviews (a random sample of 20 percent of the total reviews eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) nursing research associates. Quality appraisal was assessed using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews; see <http://amstar.ca/index.php>) and RNAO's scoring system that rates reviews as low, moderate, or strong (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). The research associates reached acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic, K=0.73), which justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction for the remaining reviews. The remaining reviews were divided equally between the two research associates for quality appraisal and data extraction. Research summaries of literature findings were completed and used to narratively describe the results. The comprehensive data tables and research summaries were provided to all expert panel members for review and discussion.

A complete bibliography of all full text articles screened for inclusion is available (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Guideline Development Process**

For this revised guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope, and was supported by the five research questions listed below. The systematic review was conducted to capture relevant peer-reviewed literature published between January 2011 and May‚ÄìAugust 2016. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review: 

  1. What are the most effective ways to identify adults at risk for falls or at risk for injury due to falls? 
  2. What interventions are effective in preventing falls and reducing the risk for falls or falls-related injury (among people at risk for falls)? 
  3. What interventions or processes should occur immediately following a fall? 
  4. What education should be included in training and ongoing educational programs for nurses and other healthcare providers to effectively prevent falls and injury from falls? 
  5. What organizational policies and system-level supports are required to effectively prevent falls and injury from falls (among those at risk for falls/injury from falls)? 



The RNAO Best Practice Guideline Program Team and expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence, and ensure the validity, appropriateness, and safety of the guideline recommendations with supporting evidence and/or expert panel consensus. 

A modified Delphi technique was employed to obtain panel consensus on the recommendations.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Not applicable

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Stakeholder reviewers for the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) best practice guidelines (BPGs) are identified in two ways. First, stakeholders are recruited through a public call issued on the RNAO Web site (<http://rnao.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder>). Second, individuals and organizations with expertise in the guideline topic area are identified by the Best Practice Guideline Program Team and expert panel and are directly invited to participate in the review.

Stakeholder reviewers are individuals with subject matter expertise in the guideline topic or who may be affected by the implementation of the guideline. Reviewers may be nurses and other point-of-care health-care providers, nurse executives, administrators, researchers, members of the interprofessional team, educators, nursing students, or persons and family. RNAO aims to solicit stakeholder expertise and perspectives representing diverse healthcare sectors, roles within nursing and other professions (e.g., clinical practice, research, education, and policy), and geographic locations. 

Reviewers are asked to read a full draft of the guideline and participate in the review prior to its publication. Stakeholder feedback is submitted online by completing a survey questionnaire. The stakeholders are asked the following questions about each recommendation:

  * Is this recommendation clear? 
  * Do you agree with this recommendation? 
  * Is the discussion of evidence thorough and does the evidence support the recommendation? 



The survey also provides an opportunity to include comments and feedback for each section of the guideline. Survey submissions are compiled and feedback is summarized by the RNAO Best Practice Guideline Program Team. 

Together with the expert panel, RNAO reviews and considers all feedback and, if necessary, modifies the guideline content and recommendations prior to publication to address the feedback received. 

Stakeholder reviewers have given consent to the publication of their names and relevant information in the original guideline document.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * Collecting details of falls history can provide insight into risk factors or conditions (e.g., gait problems, low blood pressure) that require intervention. 
  * Health histories may detect biological, behavioural, psychological, and/or socio-economic risk factors and health conditions associated with an increased risk for falls. 
  * Engaging the person's family and social networks may support falls prevention efforts. Social support, such as advice and encouragement from health-care providers and family members, also helps promote adherence to interventions. 
  * Education together with other falls prevention measures appears to contribute to falls reduction in hospitals and community settings. 
  * In long-term-care settings, a combination of interventions individualized to the person and delivered by an interprofessional team was found to be effective at reducing the number of falls and recurrent falls. Individualized interventions appear to have even greater benefits for people living in long-term care who have dementia, compared to those who do not. 
  * Exercise interventions and physical training improve strength and balance, and reduce falls and fall injuries, particularly fractures. Exercise has numerous other benefits, such as reducing functional decline and fear of falling, and improving socialization, self-esteem, quality of life, and general physical and mental health. Refer to Table 18 in the original guideline document for additional information. 
  * Hip protectors likely reduce the risk of hip fracture among older adults in long-term-care settings, without increasing the risk for falls. Potential benefits of hip protectors include reduction of sustaining a hip fracture if worn appropriately and worn at the time of a fall, avoidance of serious consequences of hip fractures, including pain, loss of mobility, and death, and reduction in fear related to fracture. Refer to Table 4 in the original guideline document for additional information. 
  * Post-fall processes can reduce the negative consequences of falls, inform interventions to prevent or reduce future falls, and lead to quality improvement for health-care organizations. 
  * Rounding, the act of checking in on patients in person on a regular basis (e.g., hourly) to proactively meet their needs, was found to contribute to reducing the number of falls in hospital settings. Regular rounding can be considered an approach for comprehensive care and has other potential benefits, such as reduced pressure injuries, reduced call-light use, improved patient satisfaction, and improved patient perception of staff responsiveness to needs. 



## Potential Harms


  * Preventing or reducing falls and injury from falls requires a balance between reducing the risks and maintaining a person's freedom, dignity, and quality of life. When trying to prevent a person from falling, family members, caregivers, and health-care providers may focus on preventative measures that inadvertently constrain the person's independence. Health-care organizations are cautioned to avoid "an excessively custodial and risk averse approach". Organizational vigilance is required to avoid harmful or adverse approaches aimed at preventing falls, such as physical restraints, sedating medications, or restricting mobility 
  * Caution should be taken when recommending exercise to those at high risk of fracture. 
  * Potential harms of hip protectors include a slight increase in the risk of pelvic fractures and skin irritation. Refer to Table 4 in the original guideline document for additional information. 
  * As rounding can potentially disrupt sleep or meals, efforts should be made to address possible unintended negative effects. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * These guidelines are not binding on nurses, other health-care providers, or the organizations that employ them. The use of these guidelines should be flexible, and based on individual needs and local circumstances. They constitute neither a liability nor discharge from liability. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents at the time of publication, neither the authors nor the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) gives any guarantee as to the accuracy of the information contained in them or accepts any liability with respect to loss, damage, injury, or expense arising from any such errors or omission in the contents of this work. 
  * This nursing best practice guideline (BPG) is a comprehensive document that provides resources for evidence-based nursing practice. It is not intended to be a manual or "how to" guide, but rather a tool to guide best practices and enhance decision-making for nurses and other health-care providers working with adults (18 years and older) who are at risk for falls and fall injuries. The Guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of individual organizations or practice settings, and the needs and preferences of persons and their families accessing the health system for care and services. In addition, the Guideline offers an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



Implementing guidelines at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines for practice to change. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) _Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines_ (2nd ed.; 2012) provides an evidence-informed process for doing this (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

The _Toolkit_ is based on emerging evidence that successful uptake of best practice in health care is more likely when:

  * Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation 
  * Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process 
  * Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation 
  * Environmental readiness for implementing guidelines is assessed 
  * The guideline is tailored to the local context 
  * Barriers and facilitators to using the guideline are assessed and addressed 
  * Interventions to promote use of the guideline are selected 
  * Use of the guideline is systematically monitored and sustained 
  * Evaluation of the guideline's impact is embedded in the process 
  * There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation 



The _Toolkit_ uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge to the local context and implementation. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools, such as guidelines, to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.

RNAO is committed to widespread deployment and implementation of the Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs). The RNAO uses a coordinated approach to dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including:

  1. The Nursing Best Practice Champion Network¬Æ, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs 
  2. Nursing order sets, which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic medical records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments 
  3. The Best Practice Spotlight Organization¬Æ (BPSO¬Æ) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs¬Æ focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs 



In addition, the RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation.

Information about RNAO implementation strategies can be found at:

  * RNAO Best Practice Champions Network¬Æ: <http://rnao.ca/bpg/get-involved/champions>
  * RNAO Nursing Order Sets: <http://rnao.ca/ehealth/nursingordersets>
