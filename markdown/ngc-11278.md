# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



To conduct this review, PubMed and CINAHL® were searched from January 1, 2009 to July 31, 2016 to review and evaluate current evidence on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of cancer-related acute pain.

The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) program conducted a literature search for pain prior to 2009. Thirty-four articles from the previous search were included in the cancer-related pain guidelines. These articles were subject to the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the articles for the new search. 

Articles from January 2002 to July 2016 are represented in this guideline.

**Pain Topic Search Strategy**

The following strategy was used across all four pain guidelines (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

**Databases Used**

_PubMed_

(pain[ti] AND cancer[ti]) OR ((pain[ti] OR pain[majr]) AND neoplasms[majr]) AND (("2009/01/01"[PDAT] : "2016/07/31"[PDAT]) AND "humans"[MeSH Terms] AND English[lang] AND cancer[sb]) 

_CINAHL ®_

  * (MH "Cancer Pain" OR (TI cancer AND TI pain)) OR ( MM pain AND (cancer OR neoplasms OR oncolog*)) 
  * Limiters: English language; clinical queries: therapy–high sensitivity, therapy–high specificity, therapy–best balance 



**Inclusion Criteria**

  * Full research report, systematic review, guideline, or meta-analysis 
  * Study must report results of measurement of pain, including acute, chronic, breakthrough, or refractory pain. 
  * The study examines a pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic intervention aimed at affecting pain. 
  * Sample must include patients with cancer. 
  * Include pediatric and/or adult studies 
  * Studies aimed at treatment of pain (may include other symptoms) rather than treatment of the cancer 
  * Sample size of at least 40, or 20 per study group 
  * For complex interventions, the description of the intervention must be sufficient to identify the components of that intervention. 



**Exclusion Criteria**

  * Gray literature 
  * Descriptive study 
  * Studies involving the use of standard short-acting or sustained or extended-release opioids (Only studies involving new formulations or unusual use of these medications will be included.) 
  * Studies involving examination of effects of different types of surgical anesthesia 
  * Studies involving surgical procedures as the primary intervention 



## Number of Source Documents



This review includes 114 studies of interventions for cancer-related acute pain. 

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

- Expert Consensus (Committee)
- Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p>Panels of advanced practice nurses, staff nurses, and doctorally-prepared nurse researchers reviewed the literature base in the identified outcome areas. Professional health services librarians assisted in the conduct of the literature searches. Based on their analysis, the panels then formulated a judgment about the body of evidence related to the intervention under consideration. Three major components were considered by the panels in classifying the collective evidence into one of six Weight of Evidence categories (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field): </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Quality of the data, with more weight assigned to levels of evidence higher in the PRISM categorization (such as randomized trials and meta-analyses) </li>
    <li>Magnitude of the outcome (e.g., effect size or minimal clinically important difference) </li>
    <li>Concurrence among the evidence (based on the premise that an investigator has less confidence in findings in which the lines of evidence contradict one another) </li>
</ul></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) information resources supervisor thoroughly searched the literature according to the strategy and search terms shown in the "Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence" field. Studies that met inclusion criteria were assigned to pairs of pain Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) team members, who reviewed and summarized included articles using a standard form. Each article was reviewed by one pain PEP team member and then peer-reviewed by the second pain PEP team member. The form included information about the purpose of the study and a brief description of the intervention, sample size and characteristics, study design, measurement instruments, conclusions, limitations that show risk of bias and threats to validity in design, and implications for nursing practice. 

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) program is a multifaceted project that involves the coordination of Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) staff as well as volunteer team contributors. PEP topic teams are comprised of volunteer nurse researchers, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses who have demonstrated experience and interest in a PEP topic. Topic leaders are nurse scientists or advanced practice nurses with demonstrated expertise in the topic through research and/or publications.

PEP team members applied the ONS PEP classification scheme (see the "Rating Scheme for the Recommendations" field) to individual interventions via Web-based meetings occurring about every six months. PEP team members included nurse scientists, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses. Classification considers all previous as well as new evidence for each intervention. Conferences are facilitated by ONS research staff and classification of individual interventions is determined by team consensus.

Teams categorize interventions based on the ONS PEP weight-of-evidence classification schema. The schema is intended to be used with existing research-based knowledge on health interventions and is based on previous research. PEP teams consider the entire body of evidence rather than a single study for classification, and more weight is given to studies that rank higher in ONS's priority symptom management project categorization. Team members also consider the magnitude of the outcome and the concurrence of the evidence for an intervention prior to assigning a classification. Interventions are classified by team consensus after application of the schema.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



 **Pharmacologic Interventions**

  * Three randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) conducted among postoperative orthopedic patients and patients who underwent abdominal cancer surgery showed significant reduction in acute postoperative pain with the use of epidural analgesia. Other benefits of epidural analgesia included reduced time to flatus and decreased average length of hospital stay. A double-blind RCT compared thoracic versus lumbar epidural analgesia in post-thoracotomy patients and showed a significant reduction in pain score and consumption of analgesics in the thoracic epidural analgesic group. 
  * A retrospective cohort study investigated the effect of intraperitoneal bupivacaine on postoperative pain in patients undergoing minimally invasive gynecologic surgeries. That study concluded that instillation of local anesthetic was associated with improved pain control and decreased median narcotic use. 
  * Along with reduced postoperative pain scores, studies of gabapentin showed additional benefits, including less use of perioperative anesthesia and rescue medication. A double-blind RCT conducted among patients undergoing transurethral resection of the bladder showed significantly lower bladder pain scores and catheter-related discomfort. Preemptive administration of a single dose of gabapentin before total mastectomy significantly reduced the postoperative pain scores and use of analgesic. 
  * An RCT using a placebo-controlled group showed lower postoperative pain score at all time points and a lower requirement for opioids with intravenous (IV) parecoxib prior to induction of anesthesia and 48 hours following gynecologic surgery. 
  * A double-blind randomized trial showed preoperative intraspinal morphine doses (0.5 mg and 1 mg) having longer pain control and less analgesic consumption without a difference in adverse effects compared to a dose of 0.2 mg prior to surgery. A double-blind RCT showed that patients receiving intraspinal morphine in addition to patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) had a lower need for morphine than patients with PCA alone. 
  * An RCT demonstrated the effectiveness of naproxen (Aleve) in reducing the incidence and severity of pegfilgrastim (Neulasta)-induced bone pain. 
  * A double-blind RCT evaluated the analgesic efficacy of nefopam (Acupan) on acute and chronic pain after breast surgery. Women were randomized to either the nefopam intervention group or the normal saline placebo-controlled group, in addition to preoperative midazolam and the same anesthetic regimen. Pain scores were significantly lower in the nefopam group at multiple time points during the first 24 hours of surgery. 



**Nonpharmacologic Interventions**

  * Several studies involving adult and pediatric patients with cancer in different phases of cancer care suggested that listening to music reduced pain. 
  * Hypnosis has been tested for various cancer-related symptoms, including pain, anxiety, depression, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, hot flushes, and fatigue. Overall, current evidence supports the use of hypnosis in ameliorating acute pain in adult and pediatric populations. 



## Potential Harms



One study noted increased urinary retention with the use of epidural analgesia.

# Contraindications

## Contraindications



The U.S. Food and Drug Administration contraindicates the use of fentanyl transdermal patch in the management of postoperative pain because of the risk of serious life-threatening respiratory depression, particularly in opioid-naive patients.
