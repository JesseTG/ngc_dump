# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



#####  Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC): The following guidance was current as of May 2014. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the original guideline document for the most current version. 


**Note from NGC** : The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text of the original guideline document for detailed information on each of the screening procedures. 


The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Key Points 


####  Clinical Presentation 


Patients presenting with palpitations, irregular pulse, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, syncope, cardio-embolic disease and new or recurrent heart failure should be evaluated for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL). While AF may be asymptomatic and found incidentally, AFL is usually highly symptomatic. 


####  Diagnosis 


Electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential in the diagnosis of AF/AFL. The initial evaluation is summarized in Table 1 in the original guideline document and should include: 


  * Physical exam 
  * Laboratory evaluation: complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic profile, magnesium, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and cardiac enzymes as indicated 
  * Imaging: chest X-ray, echocardiogram 
  * Continuous telemetry monitoring in the hospital 




####  Treatment 


Initial treatment of AF/AFL depends on hemodynamic stability. 


#####  Unstable AF/AFL (refer to Figure 1 in the original guideline document): 


  * Begin resuscitation and consider other conditions contributing to instability. 
  * If instability due to AF/AFL - immediate direct current cardioversion. 




#####  Stable AF/AFL (refer to Figure 2 in the original guideline document): 


  * For emergency department (ED) patients: Screen for early cardioversion in the ED (refer to Figure 4 in the original guideline document). 
  * Administer rate controlling agents as indicated (refer to Table 4 in the original guideline document) – _[I, B]_ . 
    * Electrophysiology (EP) consult for uncontrolled rate despite adequate trial of rate controlling agents. 
  * Consider the appropriateness of a rhythm control strategy (refer to Table 3 in the original guideline document) – _[I, B]_ . 
    * If rhythm control strategy is appropriate/desired, consult EP and start immediate anticoagulation (refer to Figure 3 in the original guideline document). 
  * Consider anticoagulation based on CHA  2  DS  2  -VAS  c  score (refer to Table 2 and Figure 3 in the original guideline document) – _[I, A]_ . 
    * The choice of anticoagulant will depend on the patient's clinical circumstances and renal function (refer to Figure 3 in the original guideline document). 
    * Obtain Neurology consult prior to initiation of anticoagulation for patients with recent ischemic stroke within the prior two weeks. 
    * Patients with valvular disease and those requiring concomitant treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy should be anticoagulated with warfarin. 
    * Target-specific oral anticoagulants are preferred over warfarin in many cases. 




###  Definitions: 


####  Levels of Evidence 


  1. Randomized controlled trials 
  2. Controlled trials, no randomization 
  3. Observational trials 
  4. Opinion of expert panel 




####  Strength of Recommendation 


  1. Generally should be performed 
  2. May be reasonable to perform 
  3. Generally should not be performed 


## Clinical Algorithm(s)



The following algorithms are provided in the original guideline document:

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The literature search for this guideline was conducted prospectively using the major keywords of "atrial fibrillation" or "atrial flutter." Results were limited to humans, and published in the English language, for dates ranging from January 2011 to March 2013 on Medline. There were no limits on age groups. Results were limited to guidelines, clinical trials, and cohort studies.

Additional key words included: rate control, rhythm control, procedures, established drug therapies, novel drug therapies, clinical classification systems/risk calculators, and post-operative.

The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. The search was a single cycle.

Within the Cochrane systematic reviews, 35 reviews were found for the terms "atrial fibrillation" and "atrial flutter." Within the National Guideline Clearinghouse, these terms returned 13 guidelines.

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for selected recommendations (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

Conclusions were based on prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) if available, to the exclusion of other data; if RCTs were not available, observational studies were admitted to consideration. If no such data were available for a given link in the problem formulation, expert opinion was used to estimate effect size.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



It is hoped that standardization of care will result in improved patient outcomes, shorter length of hospital stay, lower readmission rates, and overall cost savings for the system.

## Potential Harms



  * Calcium channel blockers can cause hypotension and atrioventricular (AV) nodal block. 
  * Beta-blockers can cause hypotension and AV nodal block. Use metoprolol with caution in patients with decompensated heart failure. 
  * Amiodarone can cause hypotension (when given intravenously), pulmonary toxicity (so patients with severe lung disease are poor candidates for long-term administration), hepatic toxicity, hypo/hyperthyroidism, and ocular side effects. 
  * Digoxin can cause AV nodal block and digoxin toxicity. 
  * Anticoagulants are associated with risk of bleeding. 



Refer to Table 4 and Appendices A and B in the original guideline document for more information on specific drugs.

# Contraindications

## Contraindications



  * Drugs contraindicated in patients with accessory pathways include digoxin, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem), which slow conduction across the atrioventricular (AV) node, and can result in paradoxical acceleration of the ventricular rate, hypotension, or ventricular fibrillation. 
  * Avoid metoprolol in patients with bronchoconstriction or emphysema. Avoid esmolol and propranolol in patients with acute or active airway obstruction/bronchoconstriction or decompensated heart failure. 
  * Procainamide should be held for systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, and is contraindicated in patient with renal failure (creatinine clearance <30), severe liver disease, lupus, or baseline hypotension. 



Table 4 and Appendix A in the original guideline document provide a review of drugs used in atrial flutter/acute atrial fibrillation and include additional information about contraindications.
