# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The definitions for quality of evidence ( **high** , **moderate** , and **low** ) and strength of recommendations ( **strong** or **conditional** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


####  When to Test for Celiac Disease (CD) 


  1. Patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence suggestive of malabsorption, such as chronic diarrhea with weight loss, steatorrhea, postprandial abdominal pain, and bloating, should be tested for CD ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  2. Patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence for which CD is a treatable cause should be considered for testing for CD ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  3. Patients with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD should be tested if they show possible signs or symptoms or laboratory evidence of CD ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  4. Consider testing of asymptomatic relatives with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD ( **Conditional recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  5. CD should be sought among the explanations for elevated serum aminotransferase levels when no other etiology is found ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  6. Patients with Type I diabetes mellitus (DM) should be tested for CD if there are any digestive symptoms, or signs, or laboratory evidence suggestive of CD ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 




####  Diagnosis of CD 


  1. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody is the preferred single test for detection of CD in individuals over the age of 2 years ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  2. When there exists a high probability of CD wherein the possibility of IgA deficiency is considered, total IgA should be measured. An alternative approach is to include both IgA and immunoglobulin G (IgG) based testing, such as IgG-deamidated gliadin peptides (DGPs), in these high-probability patients ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  3. In patients in whom low IgA or selective IgA deficiency is identified, IgG-based testing (IgG DGPs and IgG TTG) should be performed ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  4. If the suspicion of CD is high, intestinal biopsy should be pursued even if serologies are negative ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  5. All diagnostic serologic testing should be done with patients on a gluten-containing diet ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  6. Antibodies directed against native gliadin are not recommended for the primary detection of CD. ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  7. Combining several tests for CD in lieu of TTG IgA alone may marginally increase the sensitivity for CD but reduces specificity and therefore are not recommended in low-risk populations ( **Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  8. When screening children younger than 2 years of age for CD, the IgA TTG test should be combined with DGP (IgA and IgG) ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 




####  Confirmatory Testing in CD 


  1. The confirmation of a diagnosis of CD should be based on a combination of findings from the medical history, physical examination, serology, and upper endoscopy with histological analysis of multiple biopsies of the duodenum ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  2. Upper endoscopy with small-bowel biopsy is a critical component of the diagnostic evaluation for persons with suspected CD and is recommended to confirm the diagnosis ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  3. Multiple biopsies of the duodenum (one or two biopsies of the bulb and at least four biopsies of the distal duodenum) are recommended to confirm the diagnosis of CD ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  4. Lymphocytic infiltration of the intestinal epithelium in the absence of villous atrophy is not specific for CD and other causes should also be considered ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 




####  Role of Ancillary Testing in CD 


  1. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing should not be used routinely in the initial diagnosis of CD ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  2. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping testing should be used to effectively rule out the disease in selected clinical situations ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  3. Examples of such clinical situations include but are not limited to: 
    1. Equivocal small-bowel histological finding (Marsh I-II) in seronegative patients 
    2. Evaluation of patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD) in whom no testing for CD was done before GFD 
    3. Patients with discrepant celiac-specific serology and histology 
    4. Patients with suspicion of refractory CD where the original diagnosis of celiac remains in question 
    5. Patients with Down's syndrome 
  4. Capsule endoscopy should not be used for initial diagnosis except for patients with positive-celiac specific serology who are unwilling or unable to undergo upper endoscopy with biopsy ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  5. Capsule endoscopy should be considered for the evaluation of small-bowel mucosa in patients with complicated CD ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  6. Intestinal permeability tests, D-xylose, and small-bowel follow-through are neither specific nor sensitive and are not recommended for CD diagnosis ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  7. Stool studies or salivary tests are neither validated nor recommended for use in the diagnosis of CD ( **Strong recommendation, weak level of evidence** ). 




####  Differentiation of CD from Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity 


  1. Symptoms or symptom response to a GFD alone should not be used to diagnose CD, as these do not differentiate CD from non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  2. A diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity should be considered only after CD has been excluded with appropriate testing ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 




####  Diagnosis Among Patients on a GFD 


  1. While standard diagnostic tests (specific serology and intestinal biopsy) have a high positive predictive value (PPV) for CD, they should not be relied upon to exclude CD in patients already adhering to a GFD ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  2. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping should be used to try to exclude CD prior to embarking on a formal gluten challenge ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  3. CD should be differentiated from non-celiac gluten sensitivity in order to identify the risk for nutritional deficiency states, complications of CD, risk for CD and associated disorders in family members, and to influence the degree and duration of adherence to the GFD ( **Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  4. Formal gluten challenge should be considered, where necessary, to diagnose or exclude CD in patients already adhering to a GFD ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  5. Despite the disadvantages of neither confirming nor excluding a diagnosis of CD, some patients will opt to continue on a strictly GFD without undergoing formal gluten challenge; such patients should be managed in a similar fashion to those with known CD ( **Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence** ). 




####  Management of CD 


  1. People with CD should adhere to a GFD for life. A GFD entails strict avoidance of all products containing the proteins from wheat, barley, and rye ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  2. While pure oats appear to be safely tolerated by the majority of people with CD, oats should be introduced into the diet with caution and patients should be monitored closely for evidence of adverse reaction ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  3. People with CD should be referred to a registered dietitian who is knowledgeable about CD in order to receive a thorough nutritional assessment and education on the GFD ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ) 
  4. People with newly diagnosed CD should undergo testing and treatment for micronutrient deficiencies. Deficiencies to be considered for testing should include, but not be limited to, iron, folic acid, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 ( **Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence** ). 




####  Monitoring of CD 


  1. People with CD should be monitored regularly for residual or new symptoms, adherence to GFD, and assessment for complications. In children, special attention to assure normal growth and development is recommended ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  2. Periodic medical follow-up should be performed by a health-care practitioner with knowledge of CD. Consultation with a dietitian should be offered if gluten contamination is suspected ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  3. Monitoring of adherence to GFD should be based on a combination of history and serology (IgA TTG or IgA [or IgG] DGP antibodies) ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  4. Upper endoscopy with intestinal biopsies is recommended for monitoring in cases with lack of clinical response or relapse of symptoms despite a GFD ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  5. Monitoring of people with CD should include verification of normalization of laboratory abnormalities detected during initial laboratory investigation ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 




####  Non-Responsive CD (NRCD) or Refractory CD (RCD) 


  1. Patients with NRCD should be evaluated carefully to identify and treat the specific etiology in each patient ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  2. Early steps in the evaluation should include measurement of celiac serologies and a thorough review of the patient's diet by a dietitian who is experienced in CD management ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 
  3. Differentiation should be made between Type I and Type II refractory CD as this is important for management and prognosis ( **Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  4. Treatment with medication, as an adjunct to the GFD, should be considered in refractory CD ( **Conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence** ). 
  5. Patients with RCD should be monitored closely and receive aggressive nutritional support including parenteral nutrition whenever indicated ( **Strong recommendation, high level of evidence** ). 




###  Definitions: 


####  Definition of Grades of Evidence 


The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the quality of evidence. 


**High** = Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect 


**Moderate** = Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate 


**Low** = Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate 


**Very Low** = Any estimate of effect is very uncertain 


####  Strength of Recommendations 


A "strong" recommendation is made when the benefits clearly outweigh the negatives and the result of no action. "Conditional" is used when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefit/potential harm. 
## Clinical Algorithm(s)

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



In an effort to make our new guidelines as "fresh" as possible when published, we have created a special guideline review process, involving members of the Board of Trustees, Practice Parameters Committee and the American Journal of Gastroenterology. It is our goal to review the guideline, allow you to revise the guideline, and re-review the guideline within 6 months of first submission. Therefore the entire process should take 1 year from commission to finished, accepted guideline.
