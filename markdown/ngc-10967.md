# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the quality of the evidence ( **A-D** , **X** ) and the strength of the recommendation ( **Strong** , **Moderate** , **Weak** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) Definition 


Clinicians should use the term BRUE to describe an event occurring in an infant  <1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥1 of the following: 


  * Cyanosis or pallor 
  * Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing 
  * Marked change in tone (hyper or hypotonia) 
  * Altered level of responsiveness 




Moreover, clinicians should diagnose a BRUE only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination (see Tables 2 and 3 in the original guideline document).

# Scope

## Disease/Condition(s)



Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) marked by sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥1 of the following: 

  * Cyanosis or pallor 
  * Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing 
  * Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia) 
  * Altered level of responsiveness 



## Guideline Category

- Evaluation
- Management
- Risk Assessment

## Clinical Specialty

- Emergency Medicine
- Family Practice
- Pediatrics

## Intended Users

- Advanced Practice Nurses
- Hospitals
- Nurses
- Physician Assistants
- Physicians

## Guideline Objective(s)



  * To recommend the replacement of the term apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) with a new term, brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) 
  * To provide an approach to patient evaluation that is based on the risk that the infant will have a recurring event or has a serious underlying disorder 
  * To provide evidence-based management recommendations, or key action statements, for lower-risk patients whose history and physical examination are normal 
  * To provide implementation support and suggest directions for future research 



## Target Population



Infants less than 1 year of age presenting with lower-risk brief, resolved unexplained event (BRUE)

**Note** : This guideline does not offer recommendations for higher-risk patients whose history and physical examination suggest the need for further investigation and treatment (because of insufficient evidence or the availability of clinical practice guidelines specific to their presentation).

## Interventions and Practices Considered

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The subcommittee performed a comprehensive review of the literature related to apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs) from 1970 through 2014. Articles from 1970 through 2011 were identified and evaluated by using "Management of Apparent Life-Threatening Events in Infants: A Systematic Review," authored by the Society of Hospital Medicine's ALTE Expert Panel (which included 4 members of the subcommittee). The subcommittee partnered with the Society of Hospital Medicine Expert Panel and a librarian to update the original systematic review with articles published through December 31, 2014, with the use of the same methodology as the original systematic review. PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies involving children younger than 24 months by using the stepwise approach specified in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Search terms included "ALTE(s)," "apparent life threatening event(s)," "life threatening event(s)," "near miss SIDS" or "near miss sudden infant death syndrome," "aborted crib death" or "aborted sudden infant death syndrome," and "aborted SIDS" or "aborted cot death" or "infant death, sudden." The Medical Subject Heading "infantile apparent life threatening event," introduced in 2011, was also searched but did not identify additional articles.

In updating the systematic review published in 2012, pairs of 2 subcommittee members used validated methodology to independently score the newly identified abstracts from English language articles (n=120) for relevance to the clinical questions (Supplemental Fig. 3 in the Supplemental Information [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).

## Number of Source Documents



The final recommendations were based on 55 articles identified in the updated (n=18) and original (n=37) systematic reviews.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Two independent reviewers critically appraised the full text of the newly identified articles (n=23) using a structured data collection form based on published guidelines for evaluating medical literature. They recorded each study's relevance to the clinical question, research design, setting, time period covered, sample size, patient eligibility criteria, data source, variables collected, key results, study limitations, potential sources of bias, and stated conclusions. If at least 1 reviewer judged an article to be relevant on the basis of the full text, subsequently at least 2 reviewers critically appraised the article and determined by consensus what evidence, if any, should be cited in the systematic review. Selected articles used in the earlier review were also reevaluated for their quality. The final recommendations were based on articles identified in the updated (n=18) and original (n=37) systematic review (Supplemental Table 7 in the Supplemental Information [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



In July 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a multidisciplinary subcommittee composed of primary care clinicians and experts in the fields of general pediatrics, hospital medicine, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, child abuse, sleep medicine, pulmonary medicine, cardiology, neurology, biochemical genetics, gastroenterology, environmental health, and quality improvement. The subcommittee also included a parent representative, a guideline methodologist/informatician, and an epidemiologist skilled in systematic reviews. The subcommittee performed a comprehensive review of the literature related to apparent life-threatening events (ALTEs) from 1970 through 2014.

The resulting systematic review was used to develop the guideline recommendations by following the policy statement from the AAP Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management, "Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice Guidelines." Decisions and the strength of recommendations were based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence from the updated literature review by 2 independent reviewers and incorporation of a previous systematic review. Expert consensus was used when definitive data were not available. If committee members disagreed with the rest of the consensus, they were encouraged to voice their concern until full agreement was reached. If full agreement could not be reached, each committee member reserved the right to state concern or disagreement in the publication (which did not occur). Because the recommendations of this guideline were based on the ALTE literature, the subcommittee relied on the studies and outcomes that could be attributable to the new definition of lower- or higher-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) patients.

Key action statements were generated by using BRIDGE-Wiz (Building Recommendations in a Developers Guideline Editor), an interactive software tool that leads guideline development teams through a series of questions that are intended to create clear, transparent, and actionable key action statements. BRIDGE-Wiz integrates the quality of available evidence and a benefit harm assessment into the final determination of the strength of each recommendation. Evidence-based guideline recommendations from the AAP may be graded as strong, moderate, weak based on low-quality evidence, or weak based on balance between benefits and harms. Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" recommendation statements, whereas weak recommendation may be recognized by use of "may" or "need not" (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * This guideline may be of interest to parents and payers, but it is not intended to be used for reimbursement or to determine insurance coverage. This guideline is not intended as the sole source of guidance in the evaluation and management of brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs) but rather is intended to assist clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. 
  * The guidance in this report does not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



**Dissemination and Implementation**

Dissemination and implementation efforts are needed to facilitate guideline use across pediatric medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, research, and patient/family communities. The following general approaches and a Web-based toolkit are proposed for the dissemination and implementation of this guideline.

**Education**

Education will be partially achieved through the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) communication outlets and educational services ( _AAP News_ , _Pediatrics_ , and PREP). Further support will be sought from stakeholder organizations (American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, American Board of Pediatrics, Society of Hospital Medicine). A Web-based toolkit (to be published online) will include caregiver handouts and a shared decision-making tool to facilitate patient- and family-centered care. Efforts will address appropriate disease classification and diagnosis coding. 

**Integration of Clinical Workflow**

An algorithm is provided (Figure 1 in the original guideline document) for diagnosis and management. Structured history and physical examination templates also are provided to assist in addressing all of the relevant risk factors for brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs) (see Tables 2 and 3 in the original guideline document). Order sets and modified documents will be hosted on a Web-based learning platform that promotes crowd-sourcing. 

**Administrative and Research**

International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, diagnostic codes are used for billing, quality improvement, and research; and new codes for lower- and higher-risk BRUEs will need to be developed. In the interim, the current code for an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) (799.82) will need to be used for billing purposes. Efforts will be made to better reflect present knowledge and to educate clinicians and payers in appropriate use of codes for this condition. 

**Quality Improvement**

Quality improvement initiatives that provide Maintenance of Certification credit, such as the AAP's PREP and EQIPP courses, or collaborative opportunities through the AAP's Quality Improvement Innovation Networks, will engage clinicians in the use and improvement of the guideline. By using proposed quality measures, adherence and outcomes can be assessed and benchmarked with others to inform continual improvement efforts. Proposed measures include process evaluation (use of definition and evaluation), outcome assessment (family experience and diagnostic outcomes), and balancing issues (cost and length of visit). Future research will need to be conducted to validate any measures.
