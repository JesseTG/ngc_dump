# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The strength of the recommendation (strongly recommended, recommended, or no recommendation) and the quality of the evidence (1a-5b) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


It is recommended that nurses working in pediatric intensive care settings receive training that includes compassion fatigue awareness, coping strategies, stress management, relaxation techniques and self-care interventions to decrease the level of compassion fatigue experienced in the work environment (Marine et al., 2009 [1a]; Gunusen & Ustun, 2010 [2a]; Kravits et al., 2010 [4a]; Meadors & Lamson 2008, [4a]).

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation. This Best Evidence Statement does not preclude using care modalities proven efficacious in studies published subsequent to the current revision of this document. This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients. Adherence to this Statement is voluntary. The clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient must make the ultimate judgment regarding the priority of any specific procedure.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



 **Applicability Issues**

Implementation of a compassion fatigue training program would require trained instructors educated in the components needed to meet the desired objectives, including compassion fatigue awareness, self-care and coping skills. Resources required would include a comfortable learning environment, materials and supplies needed for training, such as paper or electronic copies of materials for participants, and presentation equipment. Participants would require time away from the patient care area for training which could be incorporated into approved educational time. Small numbers of participants could attend multiple sessions, due to the limitations of removing a large number of staff from the unit at one time.
