# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the level of evidence ( **I-III** ) and levels of recommendation ( **I-III** ) are provided at the end of the Major Recommendations field. 


The effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been reported in randomized, controlled trials comparing active and sham stimulation. Based on the literature, the following recommendations can be made: (1) There is Level I evidence, based on a single Level I study, for the use of bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD. (2) There is Level II evidence, based on a single Level II study, for the use of bilateral nucleus accumbens DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD. (3) There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of unilateral DBS for the treatment of medically refractory OCD. 


###  Definitions: 


####  Evidence Classification 


**Level I** : Evidence provided by â‰¥1 well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials 


**Level II** : Evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g., case-control and cohort studies) 


**Level III** : Evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports, and studies with historical controls 


####  Levels of Recommendation 


**Level I** : Generally accepted principles for patient management that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires Level I evidence that directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming Level II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials) 


**Level II** : Recommendations for patient management that reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires Level II evidence or a strong consensus of Level III evidence) 


**Level III** : Other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion) 
## Clinical Algorithm(s)



None provided

# Scope

## Disease/Condition(s)



Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

## Guideline Category

- Treatment

## Clinical Specialty

- Neurological Surgery
- Psychiatry

## Intended Users

- Physicians

## Guideline Objective(s)



To conduct a systematic review of the literature and develop evidence-based guidelines on deep brain stimulation (DBS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

## Target Population



Adult patients with treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

## Interventions and Practices Considered



Deep brain stimulation (DBS)

  * Bilateral nucleus subthalamic 
  * Bilateral nucleus accumbens 
  * Unilateral (not recommended) 



## Major Outcomes Considered



  * Effectiveness of treatment 
  * Carryover effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



This systematic review was conducted and reported according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). A literature search was undertaken using the PubMed database for articles published between 1966 and October 2012 combining the following words: "Deep Brain Stimulation and obsessive-compulsive disorder" or "electrical stimulation and obsessive-compulsive disorder." These searches resulted in 353 abstracts, which were reviewed by three independent investigators. The flow of information through the different phases of the review is presented in the Figure in the original guideline document. Relevant articles were selected for full-text review and had to meet the following article inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Inclusion**

  * Clinical series with 6 or more patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). This limit was chosen because, due to the small number of subjects included, studies with fewer than 6 patients often reported the outcomes of individual patients rather than analyzing data for the whole population. In addition, with small sample sizes, the presence of outliers can significantly compromise the analysis of data. 
  * Clinical series with a minimum postoperative follow-up of 6 months. Although ideally longer follow-up intervals would be desirable, the 6-month timeline was selected because it was the most common follow-up interval reported in the studies pooled for analysis in the review. 



**Exclusion**

  * Studies including only preclinical data 
  * Review articles 
  * Letters to the editor 
  * Clinical series with fewer than 6 patients 
  * Clinical series with a follow-up shorter than 6 months 
  * Articles reporting on patient populations other than those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
  * Clinical series in which ablative surgery was used instead of DBS 
  * Reports that mainly addressed aspects related to surgical technique 



Of 352 articles, 7 original articles were retrieved for analysis. A total of 345 studies were excluded for the following reasons: 188 were review articles, 22 included only preclinical data, 51 were letters to the editor or had fewer than 6 patients, 44 addressed other diseases (e.g., Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome), 6 reported on the effects of ablative procedures instead of DBS, and 34 addressed questions pertinent to targeting or surgical technique. One article was common to both search lists and was included only once.

## Number of Source Documents



Six articles were selected for analysis.

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

- Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Evidence Classification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Level I</strong>: Evidence provided by &ge;1 well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials</p>
<p><strong>Level II</strong>: Evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g., case-control and cohort studies)</p>
<p><strong>Level III</strong>: Evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports, and studies with historical controls</p></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



For each of the articles included, evidence classification was graded according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) criteria (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). The level of evidence (i.e., Level I, II, or III) assigned to each article was based on study design, data analysis, and follow-up.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



For each of the articles included, strength of recommendations was graded according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) criteria (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).The strength of recommendation (i.e., Level I, II, or III) was linked to the level of evidence supporting the recommendation. The level of a recommendation could be decreased if there were methodological concerns regarding the studies that provided evidence for that particular recommendation. For each of the studies included, the author's opinion regarding the limitations is discussed in the original guideline document.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Levels of Recommendation**

**Level I** : Generally accepted principles for patient management that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires Level I evidence that directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming Level II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials)

**Level II** : Recommendations for patient management that reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires Level II evidence or a strong consensus of Level III evidence)

**Level III** : Other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion)

## Cost Analysis
