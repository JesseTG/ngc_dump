###  Summary of Literature Review 


####  Introduction/Background 


Acute onset of a cold painful leg, also known as acute limb ischemia (ALI), although not directly a significant cause of mortality, contributes significantly to morbidity. The etiologies are limited, the most common being arterial occlusion. Total venous outflow occlusion is another but much less common cause. It often results in what is known clinically as "phlegmasia cerulea dolens" (precursor to venous gangrene), with lower-extremity swelling, pain, and a dusky color. It is differentiated from arterial occlusion by the presence of distal arterial pulses. Other causes, such as prolonged exposure to cold and trauma, are rare and usually clinically obvious. 


ALI generally requires urgent treatment. Appropriate care of the patient requires assessing the source (i.e., embolic versus thrombotic occlusion) and extent of the underlying arterial obstruction. The available diagnostic studies include invasive catheter angiography and noninvasive testing. Noninvasive imaging modalities include duplex ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomography angiography (CTA). 


The published literature on imaging of peripheral artery disease (PAD) focuses almost exclusively on patients with chronic PAD. This includes asymptomatic PAD, leg pain with exertion (i.e., intermittent claudication), and critical limb ischemia (CLI, defined as chronic leg or foot pain at rest, skin ulceration, or gangrene). By comparison, the literature focused on imaging patients with ALI is very limited. Consequently, the following discussion relies heavily on studies of patients with chronic PAD. 


####  Arteriography 


Arteriography (digital subtraction angiography [DSA]) performed with iodinated contrast material remains the diagnostic gold standard for detecting peripheral vascular occlusive disease. However, new and less invasive modalities are gradually replacing it. The ability to diagnose and treat disease in a single procedure is a major benefit of DSA that remains unmatched in the treatment of acute ischemic vascular disease. There has been extensive debate regarding the cost-benefit ratios when comparing DSA and MRA. Because of the invasive character of DSA, there is a recovery period typically lasting 4 hours or more. In some countries, patients remain in the hospital overnight. If complications from DSA occur, additional intervention and prolongation of the hospital stay may add cost as well as morbidity or even mortality. To be truly cost effective, any noninvasive method would have to supplant DSA, not just precede or supplement it. 


The reported incidence of complications with DSA varies greatly. There are also risks associated with iodinated contrast materials. Most worrisome are the rare fatal systemic reactions and contrast-induced nephropathy. The nephrotoxic effects are important to consider as many patients who present with the sudden onset of a cold, painful leg are elderly, diabetic, and have impaired renal function. Carbon dioxide angiography or other imaging modalities that do not use iodinated contrast material should be considered in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 mL/min/1.73 m  2  . Also, many patients will have repeated catheter angiography over the course of their disease, and minimizing patient radiation exposure should always be considered. Angiography has also been criticized for its imperfect evaluation of outflow vessels, specifically for limited visualization of pedal vasculature and patent distal vessels beyond significant obstructive lesions. 


####  Magnetic Resonance Angiography 


MRA has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting arterial occlusive disease, using DSA as a gold standard. Early imaging protocols required 30 minutes or more of acquisition time. However, recent advances, including 3T magnetic fields, parallel imaging, multichannel coils, sequences such as time-resolved MRA, and enhanced acquisition speed, enable rapid assessment of ALI. In addition to decreased total examination times, faster acquisition reduces motion artifact and venous contamination. Motion artifact can also be corrected with automated image registration protocols. Improved spatial resolution translates to thinner slices and clearer depiction of small vessels. Most information needed for the interventional radiologist or vascular surgeon is routinely illustrated with MRA, such as a general road map of arterial anatomy, including runoff vessels and collaterals, as well as the location and extent of significant stenoses and occlusions. 


Limitations include less accurate evaluation of smaller arteries, which means that more time-consuming sequences are required to get better results. Also, limited information can currently be obtained on a routine basis regarding the character of vessel walls and detailed flow dynamics, although time-resolved contrast-enhanced MRA techniques are beginning to provide qualitative flow information. Overestimation of stenosis has been reported in native arteries and in patients with vascular stents secondary to artifacts. Overestimation in native arteries varies among sequences and may or may not be a clinical problem in specific cases. This uncertainty highlights the poor consensus on optimal protocols. In part, this is a function of the continuing evolution of technology, both software and hardware. 


Another concern with MRA is that most techniques have required the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. However, MRA has few associated complications, with the realization of the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with underlying renal dysfunction who receive these contrast materials. There has been increased interest in using other modalities or limiting the use of gadolinium-based contrast material in such patients. Significantly lower contrast doses can be used at 3T compared to 1.5T without compromising image quality. Noncontrast MRA may prove useful. However, further improvements will be required, particularly in techniques for assessing pedal circulation. Finally, blood-pool gadolinium-chelate contrast agents have prolonged retention in the intravascular space and allow for steady-state imaging that, in turn, can enable high spatial resolution acquisitions. Additional studies will be needed to confirm potential clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of such agents. 


####  Computed Tomography Angiography 


Multidetector-row technology has dramatically shortened CT acquisition times, improved spatial resolution, and improved vascular image quality depicted with CT. Multidetector CT (MDCT) scanners can image from the diaphragm to the ankles in <30 seconds using a single-contrast bolus. The use of 64-row or greater MDCT significantly increases the accuracy of stenosis detection, particularly in smaller vessels. Dynamic, time-resolved "4-D" CTA may improve accuracy even further. However, additional studies are needed before this can be confirmed. 


Sophisticated postprocessing tools enable multiplanar visualization in all 3 orthogonal axes as well as in any oblique axis. In addition to multiplanar reconstructions, both volume rendering and maximum-intensity projections can be used, each with advantages and disadvantages. Maximum-intensity projections are very accurate for larger vessels (as distal as the infrapopliteal region) but less accurate for smaller vessels. Volume rendering, including endoluminal reconstruction, is good for evaluating embolic or vascular endothelial injury. It is also valuable in evaluating heavily calcified vessels. However, interpretation from volume-rendered images or maximum-intensity projections alone is insufficient to characterize vascular lesions and should always be accompanied by an assessment of the raw axial dataset and multiplanar reformatted images. 


CTA has proven comparably accurate to MRA in evaluating peripheral arterial diseases. The advantages of CTA over MRA are its excellent spatial resolution, widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and usability in patients who have contraindications to MRI, such as those who have pacemakers or defibrillators. 


One disadvantage of CTA is the limited ability to depict the lumen in heavily calcified arteries. Calcium-induced artifact causes an overestimation of stenosis. In theory, dual-energy or spectral CTA can provide image reconstructions at various x-ray energy levels and can be used to distinguish between vascular calcium and iodinated contrast material. Initial studies have shown improved accuracy of stenosis detection and grading with dual-energy CTA compared to conventional CTA. However, early studies also suggest dual-energy CTA may still overestimate high-grade vessel stenosis as occlusion. Dual-energy CTA may also correlate less well with DSA in calcified calf and pedal arteries. Expanded clinical use of dual-energy CTA will require further validation and assessment of relative radiation doses. 


Complications related to iodinated contrast are similar to those in catheter-based angiography and have been discussed above. Cumulative radiation dose is also a concern; CTA has been increasingly used for both preprocedural planning and postprocedure surveillance. Recent advances in hardware and software, however, have achieved lower radiation dosages for a single CTA examination. Also, techniques tailored to the evaluation of lower-limb vasculature have been published that allow reduced patient radiation by decreasing kVp, while preserving the ability to evaluate the smaller lower-limb vessels. Decreasing kVp also has the added advantage of allowing lower doses of iodinated contrast as kVp approaches the iodine K-edge. 


####  Ultrasound Duplex Doppler 


In this patient population, duplex US is limited by the need for operator expertise, by poor accessibility of vessels, by heavy calcification, and often by poor overall accuracy if multilevel disease is present. Its advantages are that it can provide useful physiologic as well as anatomic information. Further, it is noninvasive, widely available, and relatively inexpensive. 


####  Echocardiography 


Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are generally not part of the initial workup but may be useful if patient symptoms could be from cardiac embolization, particularly in patients with known atrial fibrillation. TEE is more invasive and time-consuming than TTE but affords better visualization of the left atrium. TEE may be useful to look for sources of emboli when TTE is indeterminate. 


In the acute setting, however, this knowledge is unlikely to influence the immediate evaluation. Similarly, cardiac CT or MRI may identify or exclude cardiac thrombus or areas of cardiac dysfunction that might be the source of emboli, but this knowledge is not likely to have clinical impact in the acute setting. 


####  Noninvasive Physiologic Testing 


Noninvasive physiologic testing includes measurement of ankle-brachial index (ABI), segmental blood pressures, Doppler waveforms, handheld Doppler, pulse-volume recordings, transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement (TcPO  2  ), and exercise treadmill testing. Segmental studies, TcPO  2  , and exercise treadmill testing are of little use in the diagnosis and management of ALI. However, ABI measurement and handheld Doppler are simple, rapid, and reliable methods to confirm arterial occlusion as the etiology of sudden onset of cold leg when the cause is not obvious. Both ABI and handheld Doppler can also serve as objective baseline tests to follow the patient after intervention. Useful physiologic information may also be obtained. In this clinical setting, other noninvasive tests generally are not helpful as they do not provide specific information that will alter or guide therapy. 


####  Summary 


  * Arteriography (DSA) remains the gold standard for diagnosing acute limb ischemia and continues to be the only modality that allows diagnosis and simultaneous treatment of pathology. This advantage alone will ensure that it continues to be a valuable tool. 
  * Noninvasive imaging with MRA or CTA before arteriography (DSA) or surgery is accepted and common. Both MRA and CTA can be used for diagnosis and may help surgical or interventional planning. 
  * Other imaging and noninvasive physiologic testing may prove important for longer-term management but are less recommended in the acute setting.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The topic author assesses the literature then drafts or revises the narrative summarizing the evidence found in the literature. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff drafts an evidence table based on the analysis of the selected literature. These tables rate the study quality for each article included in the narrative.

The expert panel reviews the narrative, evidence table and the supporting literature for each of the topic-variant combinations and assigns an appropriateness rating for each procedure listed in the variant table(s). Each individual panel member assigns a rating based on his/her interpretation of the available evidence.

More information about the evidence table development process can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Evidence Table Development document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus (Delphi)

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Rating Appropriateness**

The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC) methodology is based on the RAND Appropriateness Method. The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures or treatments included in the AC topics are determined using a modified Delphi method. A series of surveys are conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. The expert panel members review the evidence presented and assess the risks or harms of doing the procedure balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure. The direct or indirect costs of a procedure are not considered as a risk or harm when determining appropriateness. When the evidence for a specific topic and variant is uncertain or incomplete, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence or may be the sole source for assessing the appropriateness.

The appropriateness is represented on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category "usually not appropriate" where the harms of doing the procedure outweigh the benefits; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category "usually appropriate" where the benefits of doing a procedure outweigh the harms or risks. The middle category, designated "may be appropriate," is represented by 4, 5, or 6 on the scale. The middle category is when the risks and benefits are equivocal or unclear, the dispersion of the individual ratings from the group median rating is too large (i.e., disagreement), the evidence is contradictory or unclear, or there are special circumstances or subpopulations which could influence the risks or benefits that are embedded in the variant.

The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating. To determine the panel's recommendation, the rating category that contains the median group rating without disagreement is selected. This may be determined after either the first or second rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the recommendation is "May be appropriate."

This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to articulate his or her individual interpretations of the evidence or expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized, and economical process. For additional information on the ratings process see the [Rating Round Information](http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf "ACR Web site") document.

Additional methodology documents, including a more detailed explanation of the complete topic development process and all ACR AC topics can be found on the [ACR Web site](http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria "ACR Web site") (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

If complications from DSA occur, additional intervention and prolongation of the hospital stay may add cost as well as morbidity or even mortality. 
  * The reported incidence of complications with DSA varies greatly. There are also risks associated with iodinated contrast materials. Most worrisome are the rare fatal systemic reactions and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The nephrotoxic effects of DSA are important to consider, as many patients who present with the sudden onset of a cold, painful leg are elderly, diabetic, and have impaired renal function. Also, many patients will have repeated catheter angiography over the course of their disease, and minimizing patient radiation exposure should always be considered. 
  * Cumulative radiation dose is also a concern with computed tomography angiography (CTA); CTA has been increasingly used for both preprocedural planning and postprocedural surveillance. 



**Relative Radiation Level Information**

Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists, and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. 
  * ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply individual or society endorsement of the final document.
