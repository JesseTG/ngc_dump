## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the rating of the quality of evidence ( **High, Moderate, Low, Very low** ) and the strength of recommendations ( **Strong recommendation, Recommendation, Expert consensus opinion, No recommendation** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Clinical Question 1 


####  What is the optimal testing algorithm for the assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA)? 


_Recommendation 1.1_ : In patients with advanced GEA who are potential candidates for _HER2_ -targeted therapy, the treating clinician should request _HER2_ testing on tumor tissue (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


_Recommendation 1.2_ : Treating clinicians or pathologists should request _HER2_ testing on tumor tissue in the biopsy or resection specimens (primary or metastasis), preferably before the initiation of trastuzumab therapy if such specimens are available and adequate. _HER2_ testing on fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens (cell blocks) is an acceptable alternative (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: recommendation/moderate). 


_Recommendation 1.3_ : Treating clinicians should offer combination chemotherapy and _HER2_ -targeted therapy as the initial treatment for appropriate patients with _HER2_ -positive tumors who have advanced GEA (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


###  Clinical Question 2 


####  What strategies can help ensure optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of established assays in patients with GEA? 


_Recommendation 2.1_ : Laboratories and pathologists must specify the antibodies and probes used for the test and ensure that assays are appropriately validated for _HER2_ immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing and in situ hybridization (ISH) testing on GEA specimens (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


_Recommendation 2.2_ : When GEA _HER2_ status is being evaluated, laboratories and/or pathologists should order IHC testing first followed by ISH when IHC result is 2+ (equivocal). Positive (3+) or negative (0 or 1+) _HER2_ IHC results do not require further ISH testing (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


_Recommendation 2.3_ : Pathologists should use the Ruschoff/Hofmann method in scoring _HER2_ IHC and ISH results for GEA (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


#####  Recommendation 2.4: Pathologists should select the tissue block with the areas of lowest grade tumor morphology in biopsy and resection specimens. More than one tissue block may be selected if different morphologic patterns are present (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: recommendation/moderate). 


_Recommendation 2.5_ : Laboratories should report _HER2_ test results in GEA specimens in accordance with the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Template for Reporting Results of _HER2 (ERBB2)_ Biomarker Testing of Specimens From Patients With Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach or Esophagogastric Junction (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


_Recommendation 2.6_ : Pathologists should identify areas of invasive adenocarcinoma and also mark areas with strongest intensity of _HER2_ expression by IHC in GEA specimens for subsequent ISH scoring when required (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


_Recommendation 2.7_ : Laboratories must incorporate GEA _HER2_ testing methods into their overall laboratory quality improvement program, establishing appropriate quality improvement monitors as needed to ensure consistent performance in all steps of the testing and reporting process. In particular, laboratories performing GEA _HER2_ testing should participate in a formal proficiency testing program, if available, or an alternative proficiency assurance activity (Type: evidence based; Quality of evidence: moderate/intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). 


#####  Recommendation 2.8: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against genomic testing in GEA patients at this time.

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases
- Searches of Unpublished Data

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Systematic Literature Review and Analysis**

A systematic literature search was completed for relevant evidence by using OvidSP, PubMed, and Scopus (January 1, 2008, to June 1, 2015). The search strategy included medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words to capture the general concepts of gastroesophageal neoplasms, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( _ERBB2/HER2_ ), targeted therapy, and laboratory testing methods. Database searches were supplemented with a search for unindexed literature, including a review of clinical trials and pertinent organizations' Web sites. All searches were limited to human studies. Expert Panel recommendations and a review of reference lists of included articles for relevant reports completed the systematic literature review. Detailed information regarding the literature search strategy can be found in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

**Eligible Study Designs**

Eligible study designs were determined a priori on the basis of whether they were clinical or laboratory-based studies. Clinical studies were included if they were systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses, guidelines, consensus statements, or randomized controlled trials (except for phase I trials). Additional study types were included for laboratory-based studies due to concern that relevant data would not otherwise be captured. Detailed information about included study designs is available in the Data Supplement.

**Inclusion Criteria**

Published studies were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of evidence if they met the following criteria: (1) the study included human subjects; (2) the study population consisted of patients with invasive gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA); (3) the study was published in English; (4) the study compared, prospectively or retrospectively, laboratory testing methodologies or potential testing algorithms for _HER2_ testing; (5) the study addressed one of the key questions; and (6) the study included measurable data such as the negative predictive value or positive predictive value of in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays used to determine _HER2_ status, alone and in combination; negative and positive concordance across the platforms; and sensitivity and specificity of individual tests and accuracy in determining _HER2_ status. Detailed information about the inclusion criteria is available in the Data Supplement.

**Exclusion Criteria**

Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were meeting abstracts that were not published in peer-reviewed journals; noncomparative or qualitative studies, including editorials, commentaries, and letters; animal studies; full-text articles not available in English; studies that included patients with other tumor types, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, or patients with noninvasive tumors; studies that did not include relevant measurable data; and studies that did not address at least one of the key questions. Detailed information about the exclusion criteria is available in the Data Supplement.

## Number of Source Documents



A total of 969 studies met the search term requirements. A total of 116 articles were included for data extraction. This consisted of one systematic review, two meta-analyses, two randomized controlled trials, 27 prospective studies, 69 prospective-retrospective studies, and 15 retrospective studies. Excluded articles were available as discussion or background references.

See the Literature Review Flow Diagram (Supplemental Figure 3) in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for an outline of the study selection process.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Data Extraction and Management**

Full text articles were reviewed for relevancy by two expert panel members to determine eligibility, and conflicts were resolved by the initial reviewers and further adjudicated by a project co-chair, if necessary. In cases of duplication of reporting study results, the most inclusive were retained. Articles advanced to data extraction if they addressed at least one of the key questions, contained measurable data, and were within the project's scope and met the previously described inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed by a methodologist and audited by one expert panel member. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved by discussion. A bibliographic database was established in DistillerSR and EndNote (Thomson Reuters, Carlsbad, CA) to track all literature identified and reviewed during the study.

**Quality Assessment Methods**

An assessment of the quality of the evidence was performed for all retained studies following application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using this method, studies deemed to be of low quality would not be excluded from the systematic review, but would be retained and their methodological strengths and weaknesses discussed where relevant. Studies would be assessed by confirming the presence of items related to both internal and external validity, and which are all associated with methodological rigor and a decrease in the risk of bias. These items were assessed as being either yes, no, partial, not reported (NR), or not applicable (N/A) using the methodology detailed in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

The Expert Panel rated the quality of evidence for the recommendations as high, moderate/intermediate, low, or insufficient. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation or (GRADE) method was used to rate the quality of the evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus (Nominal Group Technique)

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



In 2007, a joint Expert Panel convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) met to develop guidelines for when and how to test for _human epidermal growth factor receptor 2_ ( _HER2_ ) in patients with breast cancer, which is amplified and/or overexpressed in up to 30% of cases. In 2012, ASCO and CAP convened an Update Committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 and to revise the guideline recommendations. The Update Committee developed new algorithms for testing and recommended quality assurance monitoring that would make _HER2_ testing less variable and ensure more analytic consistency among laboratories.

Because there are important distinct differences in _HER2_ expression, scoring, and outcomes in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) relative to breast carcinoma, the need for _HER2_ guidelines (that include critical clinical and laboratory considerations) was recognized. CAP, the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), and ASCO convened an international Expert Panel to systematically review published documents and to develop an evidence-based guideline to establish recommendations for _HER2_ testing in GEA.

**Panel Composition**

The CAP Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center, ASCP, and ASCO convened an international Expert Panel consisting of practicing pathologists, oncologists, and a gastroenterologist with expertise and experience in GEA. Members included practicing clinicians and pathologists from the United States, Canada, and Europe. CAP, ASCP, and ASCO approved the appointment of the project, co-chairs, and Expert Panel members. In addition, a physician-methodologist experienced in systematic review and guideline development consulted with the Panel throughout the project, and a patient advocate also participated to convey the patient experience.

The Expert Panel met face-to-face on April 25, 2015, to develop the scope and the key questions, and on August 29, 2015, to draft recommendations and assess the quality of evidence. The Panel met a total of 16 times via Web conference in small groups to review solicited feedback and finalize the recommendations. A nominal group technique was used by the panel for consensus decision making to encourage unique input with balanced participation among the group members. An open comment period was held from December 8, 2015, to January 11, 2016, during which draft recommendations were posted on the ASCP Web site. Twenty recommendations were drafted, with strong agreement for each recommendation from the open-comment-period participants ranging from 82% to 95%. The Web site received a total of 294 comments. 

Teams of two Expert Panel members were assigned to two key questions and three to four draft recommendations to review all the comments received and provide an overall summary to the rest of the Panel. After Panel discussions, and the final quality of evidence assessment, the Panel members determined whether to maintain the original draft recommendations as is, or revise them with major content changes. Resolution of all changes was obtained by majority consensus of the Panel, using nominal group technique among the members. The Expert Panel approved the final recommendations by a formal vote.

**Assessing the Strength of Recommendations**

The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, by using the GLIDES (Guidelines Into Decision Support) methodology and accompanying BridgeWiz software (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Development of recommendations required that the Expert Panel review and identify evidence and make a series of key judgments (using procedures described in the Data Supplement [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Additionally, the Expert Panel gave its recommendations with regard to potential clinical impact by assessing benefits and harms for each recommendation, and then rated the quality of evidence for the recommendations as high, intermediate, low, or insufficient. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used to rate the quality of the evidence. CAP uses a three-tier system to rate the strength of recommendations instead of the traditional two-tier approach of strong or weak recommendations. This approach is consistent with prior CAP guidelines (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).

## Cost Analysis



Formal cost analysis or cost effectiveness was not performed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Each organization instituted a review process to approve the guideline. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) convened an Independent Review Panel representing the Council for Scientific Affairs to review and approve the guideline. The Independent Review Panel was masked to the Expert Panel and vetted through the conflict of interest (COI) process. The American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) assigned the review of the guideline to a Special Review Panel at the discretion of the ASCP Executive Office and Board of Directors. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) approval process required the review and approval of the Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee.

The Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee approved this guideline on June 20, 2016.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



All patients who have documented advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) and who are considered good candidates for combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab therapy should have their tumor tissue tested for _human epidermal growth factor receptor 2_ ( _HER2_ ) overexpression and/or amplification. In patients with _HER2_ -positive GEA, the addition of trastuzumab can increase the response rate, prolong progression-free survival, and prolong overall survival. Other than providing guidance regarding the addition of trastuzumab to cytotoxic combination (when the tumor is _HER2_ positive), _HER2_ status provides little additional value such as prognostic or predictive information. Currently, there is no evidence of benefit of _HER2_ -directed therapy in patients without advanced GEA.

Refer to the "Guideline Statements" section of the original guideline document for a discussion of the potential benefits of each recommendation.

## Potential Harms



  * False-positive or false-negative results of tests 
  * There is no documented benefit for starting _human epidermal growth factor receptor 2_ ( _HER2_ )-directed treatment in the absence of confirmed _HER2_ positivity, and there is an added potential for the patient to incur unnecessary adverse effects or costs. 
  * In the ToGA trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin in combination with trastuzumab. The cardiac adverse event rate was low (6%) and did not differ between the treatment groups. Trastuzumab was generally well tolerated, but the patients assigned to trastuzumab experienced slightly higher rates of diarrhea, stomatitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and weight loss. However, there was no difference between the groups in adverse effect frequency, or grade 3 or 4 toxicities except for diarrhea. 



Refer to the "Guideline Statements" section of the original guideline document for a discussion of any potential harms associated with each recommendation.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



The College of American Pathologists (CAP) developed the Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center as a forum to create and maintain evidence-based practice guidelines and consensus statements. Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the best available evidence and expert consensus supported in practice. They are intended to assist physicians and patients in clinical decision making and to identify questions and settings for further research. With the rapid flow of scientific information, new evidence may emerge between the time a practice guideline or consensus statement is developed and when it is published or read. Guidelines and statements are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines and statements address only the topics specifically identified therein and are not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. Furthermore, guidelines and consensus statements cannot account for individual variation among patients and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any practice guideline or consensus statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances and preferences. CAP, the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) make no warranty, express or implied, regarding guidelines and statements and specifically exclude any warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular use or purpose. CAP, ASCP, and ASCO assume no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this statement or for any errors or omissions.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The Bottom Line Box included within the guideline was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and most often published in _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ and _Journal of Oncology Practice_.

For information on the ASCO implementation strategy, please see the [ASCO Web site](https://www.asco.org/node/5376/ "ASCO Web site").
