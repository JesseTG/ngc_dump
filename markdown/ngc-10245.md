# Scope

## Disease/Condition(s)



Acute and chronic work-related shoulder dysfunctions

## Guideline Category

- Diagnosis
- Evaluation
- Management
- Rehabilitation
- Treatment

## Clinical Specialty

- Anesthesiology
- Emergency Medicine
- Family Practice
- Geriatrics
- Internal Medicine
- Nursing
- Orthopedic Surgery
- Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
- Sports Medicine
- Surgery

## Intended Users

- Advanced Practice Nurses
- Chiropractors
- Health Care Providers
- Health Plans
- Managed Care Organizations
- Nurses
- Physical Therapists
- Physician Assistants
- Utilization Management

## Guideline Objective(s)



  * To provide a tool for utilization review staff to appropriately authorize shoulder surgery for injured workers, and to guide health care providers in the appropriate and allowable treatment for shoulder injuries for injured workers covered by the Washington State workers' compensation system 
  * To serve as an educational resource for health care providers who treat injured workers in the Washington workers' compensation system under Title 51 Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and as review criteria for the department's utilization review team to help ensure treatment of shoulder injuries is of the highest quality 
  * To provide standards that ensure a uniformly high quality of care for injured workers in Washington State 



## Target Population



Injured workers with acute and chronic shoulder dysfunctions

## Interventions and Practices Considered



 **Diagnosis/Evaluation**

  1. History and clinical exam, including tests such as labral loading test and apprehension/relocation test 
  2. Diagnostic imaging 



**Treatment/Management/Rehabilitation**

  1. Conservative treatment 
    * Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) medications and acetaminophen 
    * Brief rest and immobilization (less than 4 days) 
    * Unloaded movement and manual interventions 
    * Therapeutic exercise and mobilization 
    * Strengthening exercise 
    * Corticosteroid injections 
    * Ergonomic interventions 
  2. Surgical treatment 
    * Rotator cuff repair 
    * Revision rotator cuff repair 
    * Partial claviculectomy (includes Mumford procedure) 
    * Isolated subacromial decompression with or without acromioplasty 
    * Debridement of calcific tendinitis 
    * Open treatment of acute acromioclavicular dislocation 
    * Repair, debridement, or biceps tenodesis for labral lesion, including superior labral tear from anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears 
    * Capsulorrhaphy (Bankart procedure) 
    * Tenodesis or tenotomy of long head of biceps 
    * Total/hemi shoulder arthroplasty 
    * Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty 
    * Manipulation under anesthesia/arthroscopic capsular release 



**Note** : Diagnostic arthroscopy is not currently accepted as a viable treatment option. The following treatments were considered but are not authorized: allografts or xenografts in rotator cuff tear repair; distal clavicle excision as a routine part of rotator cuff repair.

## Major Outcomes Considered



  * Functional improvement of shoulder 
  * Pain relief 
  * Return to work 
  * Recurrent instability rate 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The bulk of the literature search and review was conducted from November 2012 to March 2013. Additional searches were conducted as requested by the Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee Subcommittee members. Search results were limited to human adults only and English only and in some cases filtered to studies published in the last 10 years.

PubMed was the main database searched for peer-reviewed articles. The following keywords were used in PubMed: _shoulder surgery and workers compensation, rotator cuff tear repair and workers compensation, rotator cuff tear repair, acromioclavicular dislocation treatment, long head of the biceps, tenodesis of biceps, diagnostic arthroscopy, bankart repair, clavicular fractures, recurrent dislocation treatment, subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair, SLAP tear repair, partial rotator cuff tear repair and treatment, shoulder injury and imaging, rotator cuff tears and imaging, SLAP tears and imaging, shoulder injury and work relatedness, conservative treatment and shoulder injury_.

Additional citation tracking was also performed by department staff for potentially relevant studies not initially retrieved from the electronic database.

## Number of Source Documents



319 abstracts were reviewed, 129 full texts reviewed and 71 cited in this guideline.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p>The quality and strength of the evidence were assessed using the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) clinical guideline process manual rating scheme. Refer to the AAN Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual, <a href="https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/Home/Development" title="AAN Web site">https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/Home/Development</a>.</p></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



A systematic review and summary of the relevant peer reviewed medical literature is done and is presented to the subcommittee for their review. Claim and billing data from Labor & Industries may also be reviewed.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The process for guideline development is contained in a separate document, titled Medical Treatment Guidelines in Washington Workers' Compensation, June 2010 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). The process can be summarized as follows:

  1. A subcommittee of the Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) was formed with practicing health care providers, including physicians, a physical therapist, and professional utilization review staff. The subcommittee met 5 times between February and October 2013. 
  2. A systematic review and summary of the relevant peer-reviewed medical literature was done and presented to the subcommittee for their review. Claim and billing data from Labor and Industries were also reviewed. 
  3. Drafts of the guideline were formulated and reviewed and modified by the subcommittee members. 



## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Not applicable

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



  * After the full advisory committee has given their input and any recommended changes are made, the third draft guideline is posted on the web and distributed via a provider listserv for public review and comment. 
  * Once all public comments are received and reviewed, responses are provided by the subcommittee. Both comments and responses are posted on the web. 
  * The subcommittee may make further revisions to the draft guideline based on public input and any other information they have received. This then results in a fourth draft. 
  * The fourth draft is presented to the full advisory committee in an open public meeting. Oral comments are invited from the public, and the full committee may recommend further changes, potentially creating a fifth and final draft. 
  * Once the full committee makes the advisory recommendation to adopt the guideline, it becomes final and is again posted on the web and distributed via the provider listserv. 
  * Labor & Industries (L&I) then posts on the web a Provider Bulletin announcing the new or revised guideline and distributes it via the provider listserv. 



# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



This guideline was based on the weight of the best available clinical and scientific evidence from a systematic review of the literature and on a consensus of expert opinion.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * Appropriate authorization of shoulder surgeries by the utilization review team and claim adjudicators, leading to better outcomes for workers with shoulder injuries 
  * One anticipated benefit is decreasing surgical procedures that are unnecessary to the health of the worker, such as distal claviculectomies routinely done with rotator cuff repairs. The diagnostic criteria will help ensure that surgery is performed when there is clear evidence that it will be of benefit. 



## Potential Harms



Care must be exercised when giving a corticosteroid injection to a partial rotator cuff tear, as this may lead to tear extension. Because corticosteroid use is associated with side effects such as weakening of connective tissue, no more than 3 injections are recommended under one claim for the shoulder, 4 injections per lifetime.

# Contraindications

## Contraindications



  * Smoking/nicotine use is a strong relative contraindication for rotator cuff surgery. 
  * Revision rotator cuff surgery should not be done if a patient has a massive rotator cuff tear (i.e., tears >3 cm or with severe fatty infiltration). 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



In order for a shoulder condition to be allowed as an occupational disease, the provider must document that the work exposures created a risk of contracting or worsening the condition relative to the risks in everyday life, on a more-probable-than-not basis.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



Most guidelines are implemented within the utilization review (UR) program. Labor and Industries (L&I) guidelines have priority over other proprietary guidelines and criteria that may exist. Where L&I guidelines are not available, proprietary ones may be used. Reviewers apply each guideline as a standard for the majority of requests in the Washington workers' compensation program. For the minority of workers who appear to fall outside of the guideline and whose complexity of clinical findings exceeds the specificity of the guideline, further review by a physician is conducted.

When a surgical procedure is requested for a patient who meets the guideline criteria, the reviewer will recommend approval to the claim manager. If the criteria are not met, the request will be referred to a physician consultant who will review the patient's file, offer to discuss the case with the requesting physician, and make a recommendation to the claim manager. The flexibility built into this decision making process is important in two ways. First, it enables the Washington State Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) to develop surgical indications fairly quickly. Second, it plays a major role in legitimizing the work of the subcommittee in the eyes of practicing physicians in Washington.

Completed guidelines will be communicated to practicing physicians via L&I's website and through its provider listserv (<http://www.lni.wa.gov/Main/Listservs/Provider.asp>). Education and training will be provided to reviewers and staff to ensure their proper application within the UR program. Where possible, continuing medical education (CME) credits may be offered.
