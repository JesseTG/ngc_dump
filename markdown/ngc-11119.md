  * The guideline authors conditionally recommend continuous treatment with NSAIDs over on-demand treatment with NSAIDs ( **Very Low-Quality Evidence** ). 
  * The guideline authors do not recommend any particular NSAID as the preferred choice ( **Moderate- to Low-Quality Evidence; Conditional Recommendation** ). 




In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, the guideline authors conditionally recommend against treatment with slow-acting antirheumatic drugs (SAARDs) ( **Very Low- to Moderate-Quality Evidence, depending on the drug** ). 


In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs: 


  * The guideline authors strongly recommend treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) over no treatment with TNFi ( **Moderate-Quality Evidence** ). 
  * The guideline authors do not recommend any particular TNFi as the preferred choice, except for patients with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease or recurrent iritis ( **Moderate-Quality Evidence; Conditional Recommendation** ). 




In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs and who have contraindications to TNFi, the guideline authors conditionally recommend treatment with a SAARD over treatment with a non-TNFi biologic agent ( **Very Low to Low-Quality Evidence, depending on the drug** ). 


In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used:

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Developing the PICO Questions**

Guidelines are most useful when they provide specific actionable advice on choosing between alternative approaches in particular clinical situations. Therefore, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method advocates specifying 4 elements for each clinical question to be addressed by the recommendations: the Patient (or Population) to whom the recommendation will apply; the Intervention being considered; the Comparison (which may be "no action" or an alternative intervention); and the Outcomes affected by the intervention (PICO). These PICO elements are arranged into the questions to be addressed in the literature searches. Each PICO question then forms the basis for a recommendation.

The core group initially generated 90 PICO questions in the following 6 topic areas: pharmacologic therapy, rehabilitation, surgery, specific comorbidities, disease monitoring, and preventive care. After public comment, the group reduced the scope to 57 PICO questions (37 for ankylosing spondylitis [AS] and 20 for nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis [SpA]) thought to address the central aspects of treatment (see online Supplements A and B of the original guideline document; see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

Because therapy goals of most treatments are similar, the group developed a common outcomes framework to apply across PICO questions. The framework included 5 major outcomes: mortality, health status, functional status, serious adverse events, and comorbidities (see the "Major Outcomes Considered" field). For health status and functional status, patient-reported outcomes as the primary outcome measures were used, because these more directly reflect the impact of the condition on the individual. The group considered data on surrogate outcomes (e.g., spinal range of motion) only when data on patient-reported outcomes were not available. For rehabilitation interventions, the outcomes were health status, functional status, and adverse events.

**Literature Searches**

Systematic literature reviews were conducted for the following domains: pharmacologic therapy, physical therapy and rehabilitation, surgery, disease activity assessment, education and preventive care, iritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The search strategies were developed by 2 experienced medical librarians in consultation with the core group and were reciprocally reviewed (see online Supplement C of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). The group searched OVID Medline since 1946, PubMed since its inception in the mid-1960s, and the Cochrane Library. Search filters were applied to retrieve study designs of interest, as well as articles on safety. Searches for medications were limited to those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any indication. The initial searches were performed in September 2013 and updated in July 2014.

For each PICO question, one literature reviewer screened titles and abstracts of retrieved articles and, when indicated, the full manuscript to identify relevant articles. A second reviewer independently screened the titles and abstracts excluded in the first review to ensure that all relevant articles were included. The group also checked prior systematic reviews. They excluded articles focused on children (ages <18 years), those in languages other than English, narrative reviews, meeting abstracts, and case reports. The literature search results appear in online Supplement D of the original guideline document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Number of Source Documents



  * Pharmacological therapy: 88 studies included 
  * Rehabilitation/physical therapy: 26 studies included 
  * Surgical treatment: 17 studies included 
  * Iritis: 4 studies included 
  * Inflammatory bowel disease: 5 studies included 
  * Preventive care: 9 studies included 
  * Disease activity measures: 2 studies included

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Data Abstraction and Rating the Quality of Evidence**

A major principle of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method is to base recommendations on the best available evidence identified through a systematic literature review and summarized in quantitative estimates of treatment effects, such as pooled mean differences or relative risks. Studies not reporting results in sufficient detail to calculate these values (e.g., those that did not include standard deviations) were not included in the evidence report. The review group synthesized these data to produce an effect estimate for each outcome, and assessed the quality of the evidence based on the risk of bias, imprecision in the estimates of effect, inconsistency among studies, indirectness (e.g., the study examined a similar but distinct patient group or intervention), and publication bias.

In GRADE, randomized controlled trials are generally assumed to provide higher-quality evidence than observational studies. Therefore, if a PICO (Patient population, a proposed Intervention, a Comparison or alternate course of action, and an Outcome) question was addressed by one or more trials, the group only summarized data from these trials in the Evidence Report (see online Supplement E of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). If a PICO question was addressed only in observational studies (and not in any clinical trial), the guideline group summarized the data from the observational studies in the Evidence Report.

GRADE uses 4 categories to rate the quality of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. High-quality evidence, which usually comes from controlled trials, indicates that the group has high confidence in the effect estimate and future studies are thought unlikely to alter that effect. Very low-quality evidence implies very little certainty about the estimate and that the true effect may be quite different.

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Deriving Recommendations**

According to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, in addition to the quality of evidence, the voting group weighed the overall balance of desirable and undesirable consequences, and the variation in how patients might value an intervention's potential benefits and risks relative to the comparison.

The strength of recommendation refers to the extent to which the panel was confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. The GRADE method specifies 4 possible strengths of recommendations, each with particular implications (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). Strong recommendations usually require high-quality evidence and reflect a high degree of confidence that future research will not change the results. Strong recommendations usually involve interventions sufficiently clear in their benefits and risks that almost all informed patients would accept the recommendation. A conditional recommendation is more appropriate when the quality of evidence is low or very low, or the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention is close, or if patients vary widely in their preferences. It is important to recognize that strong recommendations in GRADE do not necessarily imply large effects or benefits, nor a priority in which interventions should be used. Another principle of GRADE is that judgments at each step are documented so that the process of recommendation development can be traced and verified.

**Voting Process**

Voting group members were sent the Evidence Report and asked to submit a nonbinding vote on their recommendation for each PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) question 2 weeks before the voting group meeting. At the meeting, held July 19–20, 2014 in Arlington, VA, the Evidence Report was reviewed, questions were discussed and in some cases clarified, and members voted anonymously by electronic ballots on the recommendation for each PICO question. Iterative voting and discussion continued until at least 80% of the members agreed on one of the 4 possible recommendation options.

## Cost Analysis



Although the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method allows for considerations of costs in making recommendations, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) does not routinely do so, and the guideline authors did not explicitly consider costs in these recommendations.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Prior to publication, these recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Committee on Quality of Care, as well as the Boards of Directors of the ACR, Spondylitis Association of America (SAA), and the Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN).

Public comments and the author response to public comments are available from the [ACR Web site](http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Axial-Spondyloarthritis "ACR Web site").

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are intended to provide guidance for particular patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to these guidelines and recommendations to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed or endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. 
  * The ACR is an independent, professional, medical and scientific society which does not guarantee, warrant, or endorse any commercial product or service. 
  * These guidelines are meant to apply to typical patients, rather than exceptional cases. Treatment decisions should always involve education of the patient as to anticipated benefits and potential harms. In instances when a particular medication is not recommended, it does not imply that it is contraindicated. 
  * The recommendations are limited in that the guideline authors did not examine the full range of treatment alternatives for patients with active peripheral arthritis or enthesitis, advanced options for patients who do not respond to first- and second-level systemic treatments, use of analgesics, or the use of imaging in disease monitoring. 
  * For some questions, including most of those for patients with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), the guideline authors did not identify any directly relevant data from the literature. In these cases, recommendations were based on the experience and knowledge of voting panel members, and using indirect evidence from other conditions. While there was substantial evidence for some interventions, particularly for pharmacologic treatments, there were few studies of treatment strategies or the sequencing of medications in the event of contraindications or nonresponse, or of the efficacy of different strategies of monitoring disease activity and response. 
  * While these recommendations can address common clinical situations, all treatment decisions must be individualized, with consideration of the unique aspects of each patient's presentation, medical history, and preferences. Treatment recommendations also cannot address all permutations that might affect treatment decisions. Application of these recommendations therefore requires careful assessment and sound clinical judgment. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



In addition to the original guideline document, these recommendations will be disseminated through posting on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Web site ([www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Axial-Spondyloarthritis](https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Axial-Spondyloarthritis "ACR Web site")), and through the membership of the Spondylitis Association of America (SAA) and the Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN). The main potential barrier to implementation of these guidelines is limited access to care. Financial barriers to rumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) are substantial, even for patients with medical insurance. Philanthropic organizations and pharmaceutical patient-assistance programs can in some cases help supply or defray the costs of TNFi. Many community-based health centers and public hospitals either support or can refer patients to physical therapists at reduced costs. Public hospitals also provide orthopedic surgery services to patients unable to pay for care.
