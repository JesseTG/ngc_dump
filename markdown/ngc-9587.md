####  Therapeutic Recommendations 


The guideline authors agree with others that _HLA-B*57:01_ screening should be performed in all abacavir-naive individuals before initiation of abacavir-containing therapy (see the table below); this is consistent with the recommendations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the European Medicines Agency. In abacavir-naive individuals who are _HLA-B*57:01_ -positive, abacavir is not recommended and should be considered only under exceptional circumstances when the potential benefit, based on resistance patterns and treatment history, outweighs the risk. _HLA-B*57:01_ genotyping is widely available in the developed world and is considered the standard of care prior to initiating abacavir. Where _HLA-B*57:01_ genotyping is not clinically available (such as in resource-limited settings), some have advocated initiating abacavir, provided there is appropriate clinical monitoring and patient counseling about the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), although this remains at the clinician's discretion. 


There is some debate among clinicians regarding whether _HLA-B*57:01_ testing is necessary in patients who had previously tolerated abacavir chronically, discontinued its use for reasons other than HSR, and are now planning to resume abacavir. The presence of _HLA-B*57:01_ has a positive predictive value of ~50% for immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity, indicating that some _HLA-B*57:01_ -positive individuals can be, and have been, safely treated with abacavir. However, the guideline authors were unable to find any data to show that _HLA-B*57:01_ -positive individuals with previous, safe exposure to abacavir had zero risk of HSR upon re-exposure. Although there are isolated case reports of previously asymptomatic patients developing a hypersensitivity-like reaction after restarting abacavir, there were confounding circumstances. Many of the patients had complicating concomitant illnesses that could have masked an HSR during initial abacavir therapy, and none were immunologically confirmed, making the case reports difficult to interpret. Furthermore, most of these case reports precede the availability of _HLA-B*57:01_ genetic testing, making it impossible to determine from the published data whether there could be a risk of HSR upon re-exposure to abacavir in previously asymptomatic _HLA-B*57:01_ -positive patients. 


In addition, there may also exist a small group of patients who have been on chronic abacavir therapy since before the introduction of _HLA-B*57:01_ genotyping. Given that virtually all abacavir HSR events occur within the first several weeks of therapy, and that ~50% of _HLA-B*57:01_ carriers can safely take abacavir, the guideline authors were unable to find any evidence to suggest that _HLA-B*57:01_ -positive individuals on current, long-term, uninterrupted abacavir therapy are at risk of developing HSR. Existing clinical guidelines have a blanket recommendation that all _HLA-B*57:01_ -positive individuals should avoid abacavir, regardless of patient history. Although _HLA-B*57:01_ genotyping has proven utility in significantly reducing the incidence of both clinically diagnosed and immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity in patients being newly considered for abacavir therapy, the connection between _HLA-B*57:01_ genotype and risk of HSR in patients with previous asymptomatic abacavir use is less clear. 


####  Recommendations for Incidental Findings 


#####  Although other variants in HLA-B are associated with autoimmune diseases and drug response phenotypes, they have not been associated with abacavir HSR. 


####  Other Considerations 


Abacavir skin patch testing may be performed after a case of clinically diagnosed HSR to determine whether it can be immunologically confirmed. At this time, skin patch testing is an investigational procedure, and the results should be interpreted only by an experienced immunologist. More details on skin patch testing can be found in the Supplementary Materials and Methods online (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases
- Searches of Unpublished Data

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**2012 Original Guideline**

The guideline authors searched the PubMed database (1966 to April 2011) and Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to April 2011) for keywords ((HLA OR HLA-B OR HLA-B57 OR HLA-B*5701) AND (abacavir)), as well as a more general search for (abacavir hypersensitivity).

To construct a _human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)*57:01_ minor allele frequency table based on ethnicity, the PubMed Â® database (1966 to April 2011) and Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to April 2011) were searched using the following criteria: ((HLA-B OR HLA-B57 OR HLA-B*5701) AND (genotype OR allele OR frequency)) with filter limits set to retrieve "full-text" and "English" literature. Studies were considered for inclusion if (1) the ethnicity of the population was clearly indicated; (2) either allele frequencies or alleles for _HLA-B*57:01_ genotypes were reported; (3) the method by which _HLA-B_ was genotyped was reliable and proven (no proof-of-principle experiments); (4) the sample population consisted of at least 50 individuals; (5) the study represented publication of novel data (no reviews or meta-analyses) and (6) the population studied did not have any concomitant disease (such as autoimmune conditions) that would be expected to result in a distribution of _HLA-B_ alleles that were different from the general population. In instances where genotype data from large cohorts of ethnically diverse individuals were reported, without respect to ethnicity, studies were only considered if one ethnicity was  â¥95% of the majority. Additional studies were also included from the Allele Frequency Net Database ([www.allelefrequencies.net](http://www.allelefrequencies.net "Allele Frequency Net Database")), an online repository for HLA allele frequencies from both previously published and unpublished sources, if they met the previously described inclusion criteria. All previously published data were manually checked against the original publications to verify the _HLA-B*57:01_ allele frequencies. In some cases, sample sizes or allele frequencies were updated to reflect only subjects successfully genotyped for _HLA-B*57:01_ (rather than the total sample size of the study) or to correct errata in the original publication. The combined analysis included 35,630 Europeans, 1,321 South Americans, 8,570 Africans, 1,029 Middle Easterners, 3,391 Mexicans, 12,175 Asians, and 326 Southwest Asians.

**2014 Reaffirmation**

The guideline authors searched the PubMed database (1966 to November 2013) and Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to November 2013) for keywords ((HLA OR HLA-B OR HLA-B57 OR HLA-B*5701) AND (abacavir)), as well as a more general search for (abacavir hypersensitivity).

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

- Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p><strong>Level of Evidence</strong></p>
<p><strong>High</strong>: Evidence includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate</strong>: Evidence is sufficient to determine effects, but the strength of the evidence is limited by the number, quality, or consistency of the individual studies, generalizability to routine practice, or indirect nature of the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Weak</strong>: Evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes because of limited number or power of studies, important flaws in their design or conduct, gaps in the chain of evidence, or lack of information.</p></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **2012 Original Guideline**

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium's dosing recommendations are based weighing the evidence from a combination of preclinical functional and clinical data, as well as on some existing disease-specific consensus guidelines. Some of the factors that are taken into account include in vitro cytokine profiling of abacavir-stimulated immune cells in patients with various _human leukocyte antigen B Â (HLA-B)_ alleles, as well as both retrospective and prospective in vivo clinical outcome data for abacavir. Overall, the dosing recommendations are simplified to allow rapid interpretation by clinicians. They have been adopted from the rating scale for evidence-based therapeutic recommendations on the use of retroviral agents.

Evidence was summarized into tables (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) and graded (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).

**2014 Reaffirmation**

While the guideline authors found no new evidence that would change their original recommendations, they did find one additional study that was added to the evidence table in the supplementary material (see Supplementary Table S3 in the online Supplemental material [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]). Recent studies have been published that further describe the mechanism by which abacavir can elicit an immune response through _HLA-B*57:01_. Discussion of these studies was added to the Supplementary Material online.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **2012 Original Guideline**

The authors chose to use a slight modification of a transparent and simple system with just three categories for recommendations: strong, moderate, and optional (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).

Overall, the dosing recommendations are simplified to allow rapid interpretation by clinicians. They have been adopted from the Department of Health and Human Services rating scale for evidence-based therapeutic recommendations on the use of retroviral agents.

**2014 Reaffirmation**

The guideline authors reviewed recent literature and concluded that none of the evidence would change the therapeutic recommendations in the original guideline; therefore, the original publication remains clinically current.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Strength of Therapeutic Recommendations**

**Strong** : The evidence is high quality and the desirable effects clearly outweigh the undesirable effects.

**Moderate** : There is a close or uncertain balance as to whether the evidence is high quality and the desirable clearly outweigh the undesirable effects.

**Optional** : The desirable effects are closely balanced with undesirable effects and there is room for differences of opinion as to the need for the recommended course of action.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The evidence summarized in Supplemental Table S3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) is graded on a scale of high, moderate, and weak, based upon the level of evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Every effort was made to present evidence from high-quality studies, which provided the framework for the strength of therapeutic recommendations.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



A clear benefit of _human leukocyte antigen B Â (HLA-B)*57:01_ testing is that it leads to a reduction in the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction by identifying patients at significant risk so that alternative antiretroviral therapy can be prescribed for them. Importantly, a number of effective and safe antiretrovirals are available that can be substituted for abacavir in patients carrying this risk-related allele. _HLA-B*57:01_ 's high negative predictive value (>99%) shows that it is extremely effective in identifying those at risk of immunologically confirmed hypersensitivity to abacavir.

## Potential Harms



  * A potential problem of _human leukocyte antigen B Â (HLA-B)*57:01_ testing would be an error in genotyping or in reporting a genotype. This could result in high-risk patients mistakenly being given abacavir and potentially having a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). However, given that patients testing negative for _HLA-B*57:01_ also have a 3% risk of developing a clinically diagnosed hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), standard practice would include patient counseling and careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of an HSR. 
  * Given the lifelong nature of genotype results, an error in genotyping may also have a broader adverse impact on a patient's health care if other associations with _HLA-B*57:01_ are found in the future. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications



If the symptoms of clinically diagnosed hypersensitivity reaction resolve after discontinuation of abacavir, drug rechallenge is contraindicated because immediate and life-threatening reactions, including anaphylaxis and even fatalities, can occur. In addition, an allergy to abacavir should be noted in the patient's medical record.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



 **Caveats: Appropriate Use and/or Potential Misuse of Genetic Tests**

  * The positive predictive value of _human leukocyte antigen B Â (HLA-B)*57:01_ genotyping is ~50%, which means that a significant number of patients will be denied abacavir on the basis of their genotyping results even though they would have been able to take abacavir without experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). There is currently no way to know _a priori_ which _HLA-B*57:01_ carriers are and which are not likely to experience HSRs, although new genetic risk factors may be found in the future. Given the potential seriousness of HSRs, the moderate positive predictive value is greatly outweighed by the very high negative predictive value of _HLA-B*57:01_ genotyping. 
  * _HLA-B*57:01_ is not predictive of any other adverse reactions a patient may experience while on abacavir treatment, nor does it predict whether abacavir will be effective in treating a patient's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In addition, genotyping is not a replacement for appropriate patient education and clinical monitoring for the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity. The development of signs and symptoms of an HSR warrants that serious consideration be given to discontinuing abacavir, regardless of the _HLA-B_ genotyping results.
