###  Summary of Literature Review 


####  Introduction/Background 


Ankle pain is considered chronic when symptoms persist >6 weeks. Chronic ankle pain can be caused by a variety of osseous or soft-tissue abnormalities, either alone or in combination. For assessing chronic ankle pain, there are multiple imaging options, including radiography, stress radiography, computed tomography (CT) radionuclide bone scanning, ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and various injection procedures. Injection procedures include arthrography, CT arthrography, MR arthrography, and diagnostic injection with anesthetic agents. Although there are numerous causes for chronic ankle pain, common etiologies include osteoarthritis, osteochondral injury, tendon abnormalities, ligament abnormalities and instability, and impingement. 


####  Overview of Imaging Modalities 


#####  Radiography 


Radiographs can provide information about the osseous and soft-tissue structures about the ankle. Routine radiographs of the ankle typically include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, the latter obtained by internally rotating the foot 15 to 20 degrees. Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability; however, some have questioned their accuracy. 


#####  CT 


CT is not routinely used as a first-line imaging tool in chronic ankle pain, but it is more sensitive than radiographs, particularly for osseous abnormalities. CT arthrography may be more accurate than MR arthrography for the identification of osteochondral abnormalities. 


#####  Bone Scan 


Conventional planar bone scintigraphy can assess osseous pathology. More recently, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft-tissue pathology. In addition, SPECT/CT abnormalities have been shown to significantly correlate with pain in osteochondral lesions. 


#####  US 


US can be used to evaluate for soft-tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. In inflammatory arthritis, it can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in early disease or after treatment. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability and can be used to guide interventions. Compared with some other modalities, US is less prone to artifacts, such as susceptibility, motion, magic angle, and streak artifact, but dynamic assessment may be limited in cases of pain. 


#####  MRI 


MRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and bone. Most studies have shown that MRI is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon, and osteochondral abnormalities, although one study found statistically significant lower sensitivity for these abnormalities on MRI as compared to arthroscopy. MRI can identify synovitis and impingement lesions, which can contribute to patient symptoms. 


####  Discussion of Procedures by Variant 


#####  Variant 1: Chronic Ankle Pain. Initial Imaging 


######  Radiography 


Radiography should be considered as the initial imaging study. Radiographs may reveal osteoarthritis, calcified or ossified intra-articular bodies, osteochondral abnormalities, stress fractures, or evidence of prior trauma. Ankle effusions may also be identified in the anterior ankle joint recess by radiography with 53% to 74% accuracy. They are often associated with ligamentous injury or fracture. The presence of ossific fragments can indicate ligamentous injury or retinaculum avulsion, whereas periostitis can occur adjacent to tenosynovitis. Radiographs can also identify synovial osteochondromatosis and erosions from chronic synovitis. 


######  CT 


CT is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. 


######  MRI 


MRI is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. 


######  US 


US is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. 


######  Bone Scan 


Bone scan is not routinely used as the first study for the evaluation of chronic ankle pain. 


#####  Variant 2: Chronic Ankle Pain. Multiple Sites of Degenerative Joint Disease in the Hindfoot Detected by Ankle Radiographs. Next Study 


When multiple sites of osteoarthritis are present, it may be important to determine which joint is the cause of symptoms. 


######  Image-guided Anesthetic Injection 


Several reports have indicated the effectiveness of fluoroscopic, CT, or US-guided anesthetic with or without corticosteroid injection of joints to identify a source of pain, which aids in surgical planning. 


######  MRI 


When degenerative changes of the ankle joint are diagnosed based on radiographs, MRI may be considered as the next best examination to evaluate cartilage integrity, bone marrow, and associated soft tissues, such as ligaments and tendons, if these injuries are clinically suspected. 


######  CT 


CT without contrast may be helpful to visualize subchondral cysts. 


######  US 


US is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease. 


######  Bone Scan 


Bone scan is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease. 


######  Arthrography 


Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease. 


######  MR Arthrography 


MR arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease. 


######  CT Arthrography 


CT arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of degenerative joint disease. 


#####  Variant 3: Chronic Ankle Pain. Ankle Radiographs Normal, Suspected Osteochondral Lesion. Next Study 


Osteochondral injuries may involve the talar dome and, less commonly, the tibial plafond and tarsal navicular bone. If this injury is associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, radiography may show the abnormality; however, radiography often fails to show the extent of the osteochondral injury and will be initially negative if the injury is limited to the articular hyaline cartilage. One multimodality study showed that 41% of osteochondral abnormalities of the ankle were missed on radiography. 


######  MRI 


In one multimodality study, MRI performed similarly to arthroscopy for the evaluation of osteochondral abnormalities of the ankle. Although MRI had the highest sensitivity (96%), it was less specific than CT. MRI is effective in determining osteochondral injury instability (sensitivity 97%), most commonly appearing as a high signal line deep to the osteochondral lesion on T2-weighted images or less commonly as a focal defect, an articular fracture, or an adjacent cyst. MRI has also been used to stage these lesions preoperatively with an accuracy of 81% and to assess osteochondral abnormalities after cartilage repair. Although MRI may be less reliable than CT arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions (accuracy between 76% and 88%), high-resolution MRI using a microscopy coil (e.g., a 4-cm receive-only surface coil) can assist in detecting small, clinically relevant features of talar osteochondral lesions that may be missed on standard MRI, including osteochondral junction separation due to focal collapse of the subchondral bone, reparative cartilage hypertrophy, and bone separation in the absence of cartilage fracture. 


######  CT Arthrography 


The introduction of contrast into the ankle joint prior to CT will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in lesion detection and assessment for instability. One study comparing CT arthrography and MR arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions found an accuracy between 76% and 88% using MR arthrography compared to 90% to 92% for CT arthrography, suggesting that CT arthrography may be more reliable. 


######  MR Arthrography 


The introduction of contrast into the ankle joint prior to MRI will outline a cartilage surface defect, assisting in lesion detection and assessment for instability. One study comparing CT arthrography and MR arthrography for talar cartilaginous lesions found an accuracy between 76% and 88% using MR arthrography compared to 90% to 92% for CT arthrography, suggesting that CT arthrography may be more reliable. 


######  CT 


In one multimodality study, CT (noncontrast, multidetector with multiplanar reformatted images) performed similarly to arthroscopy for the evaluation of osteochondral abnormalities of the ankle. However, CT was more specific (99%) but less sensitive then MRI. 


######  Bone Scan with SPECT/CT 


When osteochondral injuries are associated with fracture, osseous cyst, or osteochondral defect, bone scans may show the abnormality. One study evaluating the role of SPECT/CT in assessing osteochondral defects in the ankle found that this study affected the surgeon's ultimate decision regarding treatment in 48% to 52% of cases, as it allowed for improved evaluation of the subchondral bone and subchondral bone plate. SPECT/CT abnormalities have also been shown to significantly correlate with pain in the setting of osteochondral lesions and to precisely localize the painful regions in the setting of multiple lesions. 


######  US 


US is not routinely used for the evaluation of osteochondral lesions in the ankle. 


######  Radiography 


Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of osteochondral lesions in the ankle. 


######  Arthrography 


Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of osteochondral lesions in the ankle. 


######  Image-guided Anesthetic Injection 


Image-guided anesthetic injections may be helpful to assess whether an osteochondral lesion in the ankle is the source of the patient's pain. 


#####  Variant 4: Chronic Ankle Pain. Ankle Radiographs Normal or Nonspecific, Suspected Tendon Abnormality. Next Study 


Possible tendon abnormalities include tenosynovitis, tendinopathy, tendon tear (partial or complete), and tendon subluxation or dislocation. Both MRI and US can effectively demonstrate ankle tendon abnormalities, although US results are more dependent on operator skill and expertise. For the assessment, it is assumed the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert. 


######  US 


US can be used to evaluate for soft-tissue abnormalities, including tendon and ligament tears. It has been shown to produce similar results as MRI in diagnosing ankle tendon tears, although US results are more dependent on operator skill and expertise. In this case, it is assumed that the procedure is performed and interpreted by an expert. One study showed that it had a sensitivity of 100% and an accuracy of 93% compared to surgical findings. With regard to the tibialis posterior tendon, one study evaluating tendon pathology showed that US was slightly less sensitive than MRI; however, this difference did not significantly affect clinical management. One study using US showed 100% sensitivity and 90% accuracy in diagnosing peroneal tendon tears; suggesting that US may be more useful than MRI. With regard to chronic Achilles tendinopathy, US detected 21 of 26 cases of tendinosis and partial rupture, and another study showed that US can differentiate full-thickness from partial-thickness Achilles tears with 92% accuracy. In addition to the diagnostic capabilities of US, when a tendon abnormality is detected, it can be used to guide interventions such as concurrent performance of US-guided intrasheath anesthetic injections. It can also be used for direct intratendinous biologic injection and dry needling. 


One significant advantage of US is in the dynamic assessment for tendon subluxation (including intrasheath subluxation) and dislocation, with a reported positive predictive value of 100% compared to surgical findings. 


US-guided sheath injections are more accurate than palpation guided and allow for precise positioning of the needle tip in the sheath rather than the tendon substance because a large volume intratendinous injection of corticosteroids or local anesthetic can result in a split tear. 


US can detect intratendinous tophi in gout, enthesitis of the Achilles tendon or plantar fascia in spondyloarthritis, and tenosynovitis in spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 


######  MRI 


It is generally accepted that MRI can achieve high sensitivities (>90%) in diagnosing ankle tendon tears. Regarding tibialis posterior tendon, MRI is more sensitive than US; however, this difference did not significantly affect clinical management. With regard to peroneal tendinopathy and tendon tear, one study found the sensitivities and specificities of MRI to be 83.9% and 74.5%, respectively, for tendinopathy and 54.5% and 88.7%, respectively, for tendon tears. With regard to chronic Achilles tendinopathy, MRI detected 26 of 27 cases of tendinosis and partial rupture. MRI reported a 66% accuracy rate for assessment for tendon subluxation and dislocation. MRI evidence of peroneal tendon pathology should be treated with caution because up to 34% of asymptomatic patients may have a tear of the peroneus brevis tendon. One study showed that MRI evidence of peroneal tendon pathology had a 48% positive predictive value for clinical findings, highlighting the importance of clinical examination. 


######  Image-guided Anesthetic Injection 


In addition to the diagnostic capabilities of US, when a tendon abnormality is detected, a fluoroscopic or US-guided intrasheath anesthetic injection can be concurrently performed. 


######  Tenography 


Diagnostic and therapeutic ankle tenography can also be considered for evaluation, with one study reporting that 47% of patients had prolonged relief of symptoms. 


######  CT 


CT is not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality. 


######  Bone Scan 


Bone scan is not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality. 


######  CT Arthrography 


CT arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality. 


######  MR Arthrography 


MR arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality. 


######  Arthrography 


Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality. 


######  Radiography 


Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of suspected tendon abnormality. 


#####  Variant 5: Chronic Ankle Pain. Ankle Radiographs Normal or Nonspecific, Suspected Ankle Instability. Next Study 


In the absence of findings on routine radiography, imaging options to evaluate ligamentous integrity include stress radiography, MRI, MR arthrography, CT arthrography, and US. 


######  MRI 


One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for MRI when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, MRI identified the exact location of the injury in 93% of the cases. Comparing MRI with arthroscopy, studies have shown a range of accuracies of chronic lateral ligament tearing (either partial or complete), ranging from 77% to 92% for the anterior talofibular ligament and 88% to 92% for the calcaneofibular ligament. For the evaluation of deep deltoid ligament tears, MRI is both sensitive and specific compared with arthroscopy, with reported values of 96% and 98%, respectively. 


With regard to tears of the tibiofibular ligaments of the tibiofibular syndesmosis, MRI has a reported accuracy of 100%. Additionally, MRI can also demonstrate interosseous membrane tears. MRI offers the advantage of evaluating for injuries associated with or mimicking lateral instability that may not be diagnosed on stress radiography such as tenosynovitis, tendon injury, and osteochondral lesions. MRI may also be used to evaluate the ankle after lateral ligament reconstruction. 


######  MR Arthrography 


MR arthrography can be helpful for the assessment of chronic ankle instability due to lateral collateral ligament injuries. 


######  US 


One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 91% for US when compared to arthroscopic findings. Additionally, US identified the exact location of the injury in 63% of cases. Another study comparing US and CT arthrography for the diagnosis of anterior talofibular ligament injury showed an accuracy of 61% using US and 71% for CT arthrography. US also has the dynamic capability of stressing the ligament and looking for laxity or frank separation of the injured ligament. 


With regard to interosseous membrane tears, US has a proven sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 94.5% in diagnosing interosseous membrane tears shown at surgery. 


######  Radiography 


Stress radiographs can be used to assess ankle instability; however, some have questioned their accuracy. One study evaluating anterior talofibular ligament injury demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 67% for stress radiography. One study compared stress radiography to arthroscopic findings and found the former has an accuracy of 67% for evaluating anterior talofibular ligament injuries. Subtalar stress radiography using forced dorsiflexion and supination or talar rotation can be used to evaluate subtalar laxity. 


######  CT Arthrography 


CT arthrography showed an accuracy of 71% for diagnosing anterior talofibular ligament injury. 


######  CT 


CT is not routinely used for the evaluation of ligamentous integrity. 


######  Arthrography 


Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of ligamentous integrity. 


######  Image-guided Anesthetic Injection 


Image-guided anesthetic injection is not routinely used for the evaluation of ligamentous integrity. 


######  Bone Scan 


Bone scan is not routinely used for the evaluation of ligamentous integrity. 


#####  Variant 6: Chronic Ankle Pain. Ankle Radiographs Normal or Nonspecific, Suspected Ankle Impingement Syndrome. Next Study 


Imaging can also be used to diagnose ankle impingement syndromes, which can occur in the anterolateral, anterior, anteromedial, posteromedial, and posterior aspects of the ankle joint. 


######  MR Arthrography 


MR arthrography has been found to be an accurate method for assessing both anterolateral and anteromedial impingement with the advantage of joint capsule distention by intra-articular contrast injection. 


######  US 


One study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared US to arthroscopic findings. The study found US had a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 57%, respectively. US also showed abnormal soft tissues in anterolateral impingement, with a reported accuracy of 100% in one study. 


######  MRI 


Studies on the accuracy of MRI in diagnosing anterolateral impingement syndrome have drawn varying conclusions, which may be related to varying MRI magnet strengths and inconsistent protocols. Comparing MRI with surgical findings, studies have shown sensitivities between 75% and 83% and specificity between 75% and 100% for the diagnosis of anterolateral impingement. 


One study found that, when compared with arthroscopy, fat-suppressed, IV contrast-enhanced, 3-D gradient-recalled echo imaging was sensitive for the evaluation of synovitis of the ankle associated with trauma (92%), whereas it was specific for soft-tissue impingement evaluation (97%) when the ankle was divided into four compartments: the anterolateral gutter, anteromedial gutter, anterior recess, and posterior recess. 


MRI is useful in confirming the diagnosis, evaluating patients with an uncertain clinical diagnosis, and planning surgery. Additionally, it can help exclude other pathologic entities that may mimic or coexist with impingement syndromes. However, MRI features supportive of impingement may be present in asymptomatic individuals, and an accurate diagnosis requires careful correlation of imaging features findings with clinical findings. There are only limited reports on the use of MRI for the other forms of ankle impingement syndrome, so its accuracy in these conditions is not well established. 


######  CT Arthrography 


One study involving anterolateral ankle impingement compared CT arthrography to arthroscopic findings. The study found that CT arthrography had a sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 71%, respectively. 


######  Image-guided Anesthetic Injection 


Fluoroscopic or US-guided injections have been shown as an effective treatment for some ankle impingement syndromes. 


######  Bone Scan with SPECT/CT 


Recently, SPECT combined with CT has been shown to provide additional information compared with clinical diagnosis and conventional bone scintigraphy for the evaluation of impingement syndromes and soft-tissue pathology. One study found that SPECT/CT provided information not suspected on clinical diagnosis in 56% of cases with impingement syndromes or soft-tissue pathology. 


######  CT 


CT may be useful for depiction of osseous causes of impingement, such as chronic abnormalities between the talus and an os trigonum or fractures of the lateral tubercle of the talus or os trigonum. 


######  Arthrography 


Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes. 


######  Radiography 


Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of ankle impingement syndromes. 


#####  Variant 7: Chronic Ankle Pain. Ankle Radiographs Normal, Pain of Uncertain Etiology. Next Study 


When chronic ankle pain is of unclear etiology, normal ankle radiographs can be followed by other imaging tests, primarily directed by clinical findings. 


######  MRI 


If the patient has a focal soft-tissue abnormality, MRI can be considered. Peripheral nerve-related symptoms can be evaluated with US or MRI; however, US has the benefit of higher resolution. If symptoms are believed to originate from osseous structures, MRI can be considered if there is concern for an initially missed fracture. MRI is effective in detecting osseous stress injuries. Overall, MRI is the imaging test that globally evaluates all anatomic structures, including bone marrow. 


######  US 


US is best used as a focal examination and should not be used for comprehensive evaluation of the ankle when no particular pathology is suspected. If the patient has a focal soft-tissue abnormality, US can be considered. Peripheral nerve-related symptoms can be evaluated with US or MRI; however, US has the benefit of higher resolution. US with dynamic evaluation should be considered when symptoms are only present during specific movements or positions. 


######  CT 


If symptoms are believed to originate from osseous structures, CT can be considered if there is concern for an initially missed fracture. CT has been shown to be superior to radiography for fracture detection. 


######  Bone Scan with SPECT/CT 


SPECT/CT is an emerging imaging modality for evaluation of ankle pathology and can detect osteochondral lesions, osteoarthritis, tarsal coalition, occult fractures, or painful accessory bones. 


######  Arthrography 


Arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of pain of unknown etiology in the ankle. 


######  CT Arthrography 


CT arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of pain of unknown etiology in the ankle. 


######  MR Arthrography 


MR arthrography is not routinely used for the evaluation of pain of unknown etiology in the ankle. 


######  Image-guided Anesthetic Injection 


US-guided nerve blocks have been reported to be helpful for diagnostic purposes and to plan for surgical or procedural intervention. 


######  Radiography 


Stress views are not routinely used for the evaluation of pain of unknown etiology in the ankle. 


See the original guideline document for other causes of chronic ankle pain, including tarsal tunnel syndrome, suspected stress fracture, tarsal coalition, suspected tumor, and inflammatory arthritis or crystal deposition. 


####  Summary of Recommendations 


  * Radiograph of the ankle is the most appropriate initial imaging study. 
  * Image-guided anesthetic injection hindfoot/ankle, MRI hindfoot/ankle without IV contrast, or CT hindfoot/ankle without IV contrast may be appropriate as the next study for degenerative joint disease in the hindfoot detected by ankle radiographs. 
  * MRI ankle without IV contrast should be the next imaging study when ankle radiographs are normal for suspected osteochondral lesion. 
  * Either MRI ankle without IV contrast or US ankle should be ordered when tendon abnormality is suspected and ankle radiographs are normal. 
  * Either MRI ankle without IV contrast or MR arthrography of the ankle should be ordered when ankle instability is suspected and ankle radiographs are normal. 
  * MRI ankle without IV contrast should be ordered when ankle impingement syndrome is suspected and ankle radiographs are normal. 
  * MRI ankle without IV contrast should be ordered as the next study after radiographs when there is pain of uncertain etiology and ankle radiographs are normal.

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search Summary**

Of the 59 citations in the original bibliography, 50 were retained in the final document. 

A literature search was conducted in April 2015, June 2017, and July 2015 to identify additional evidence published since the _ACR Appropriateness Criteria ® Chronic Ankle Pain_ topic was finalized. Using the search strategies described in the literature search companion (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field), 1,359 unique articles were found. Thirty-eight articles were added to the bibliography. The remaining articles were not used due to either poor study design, the articles were not relevant or generalizable to the topic, or the results were unclear or biased. 

The author added 3 citations from bibliographies, Web sites, or books that were not found in the literature search. 

Five citations are supporting documents that were added by staff.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The topic author assesses the literature then drafts or revises the narrative summarizing the evidence found in the literature. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff drafts an evidence table based on the analysis of the selected literature. These tables rate the study quality for each article included in the narrative.

The expert panel reviews the narrative, evidence table and the supporting literature for each of the topic-variant combinations and assigns an appropriateness rating for each procedure listed in the variant table(s). Each individual panel member assigns a rating based on his/her interpretation of the available evidence.

More information about the evidence table development process can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Evidence Table Development document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus (Delphi)

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Overview**

The purpose of the rating rounds is to systematically and transparently determine the panels' recommendations while mitigating any undue influence of one or more panel members on another individual panel members' interpretation of the evidence. The panel member's rating is determined by reviewing the evidence presented in the Summary of Literature Review and assessing the risks or harms of performing the procedure or treatment balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure or treatment. The individual panel member ratings are used to calculate the median rating, which determines the panel's rating. The assessment of the amount of deviation of individual ratings from the panel rating determines whether there is disagreement among the panel about the rating. 

The process used in the rating rounds is a modified Delphi method based on the methodology described in the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual. 

The appropriateness is rated on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field). 

**Determining the Panel's Recommendation**

  * Ratings represent an individual's assessment of the risks and benefits of performing a specific procedure for a specific clinical scenario on an ordinal scale. The recommendation is the appropriateness category (i.e., "Usually appropriate", "May be appropriate", or "Usually not appropriate"). 
  * The appropriateness category for a procedure and clinical scenario is determined by the panel's median rating without disagreement (see below for definition of disagreement). The panel's median rating is calculated after each rating round. If there is disagreement after the second rating round, the rating category is "May be appropriate (Disagreement)" with a rating of "5" so users understand the group disagreed on the final recommendation. The actual panel median rating is documented to provide additional context. 
  * Disagreement is defined as excessive dispersion of the individual ratings from the group (in this case, an Appropriateness Criteria [AC] panel) median as determined by comparison of the Interpercentile Range (IPR) and the Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry (IPRAS). In those instances when the IPR is greater than the IPRAS, there is disagreement. For a complete discussion, please refer to chapter 8 of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual. 
  * Once the final recommendations have been determined, the panel reviews the document. If two thirds of the panel feel a final recommendation is wrong (e.g., does not accurately reflect the evidence, may negatively impact patient health, has unintended consequences that may harm health care, etc.) and the process must be started again from the beginning. 



For additional information on the ratings process see the Rating Round Information Document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). 

Additional methodology documents, including a more detailed explanation of the complete topic development process and all ACR AC topics con be found on the [ACR Web site](https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/ACR-Appropriateness-Criteria "ACR Web site") (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field.)

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Criteria developed by the Expert Panels are reviewed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The recommendations are based on analysis of the current medical evidence literature and the application of the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method and expert panel consensus.

**Summary of Evidence**

Of the 96 references cited in the _ACR Appropriateness Criteria ® Chronic Ankle Pain _document, 5 are categorized as therapeutic references including 1 well-designed study and 3 good-quality studies. Additionally, 91 references are categorized as diagnostic references including 1 well-designed study, 10 good-quality studies, and 41 quality studies that may have design limitations. There are 40 references that may not be useful as primary evidence.

Although there are references that report on studies with design limitations, 15 well-designed or good-quality studies provide good evidence. 

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * In inflammatory arthritis, ultrasound (US) can help in the assessment of disease activity and severity as well as detect subclinical pathology in early disease or after treatment. US is ideal for dynamic assessment of peroneal tendon instability and can be used to guide interventions. 
  * One significant advantage of US is in the dynamic assessment for tendon subluxation (including intrasheath subluxation) and dislocation, with a reported positive predictive value of 100% compared to surgical findings. 
  * Most studies have shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly accurate for evaluation of ligament, tendon, and osteochondral abnormalities. 
  * MRI is useful in confirming the diagnosis of impingement syndrome, evaluating patients with an uncertain clinical diagnosis, and planning surgery. Additionally, it can help exclude other pathologic entities that may mimic or coexist with impingement syndromes. 



## Potential Harms



**Relative Radiation Level (RRL)**

Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. 
  * ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply society endorsement of the final document.

## Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest



 **Disclosing Potential Conflicts of Interest and Management of Conflicts of Interest**

An important aspect of committee operations is the disclosure and management of potential conflicts of interest. In 2016, the American College of Radiology (ACR) began an organization-wide review of its conflict of interest (COI) policies. The current ACR COI policy is available on its [Web site](https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Member-Resources/Volunteer/Conflict-of-Interest-Policy.pdf/la/en "ACR Web site"). The Appropriateness Criteria (AC) program's COI process varies from the organization's current policy to accommodate the requirements for qualified provider-led entities as designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) program. 

When physicians become participants in the AC program, welcome letters are sent to inform them of their panel roles and responsibilities, including a link to complete the [COI form](https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Appropriateness-Criteria/ACCOI-form.pdf/la/en "ACRE Web site"). The COI form requires disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest. ACR staff oversees the COI evaluation process, coordinating with review panels consisting of ACR staff and members, who determine when there is a conflict of interest and what action, if any, is appropriate. In addition to making the information publicly available, management may include exclusion from some topic processes, exclusion from a topic, or exclusion from the panel. 

Besides potential COI disclosure, AC staff begins every committee call with the conflict of interest disclosure statement on the [Web site](https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/ACR-Appropriateness-Criteria/Overview "ACR Web site") reminding members to update their COI forms. If any updates to their COI information have not been submitted, they are instructed not to participate in discussion where an undisclosed conflict may exist. 

Finally, all ACR AC are published as part of the Journal of the American College of Radiology (JACR) electronic supplement. Those who participated on the document and are listed as authors must complete the JACR process that includes completing the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) COI form which is reviewed by the journal's staff/publisher.
