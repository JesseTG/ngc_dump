# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions of quality of evidence ( **high** , **moderate** , **low** ) and strength of recommendation ( **strong** , **weak** , **insufficient** , **not applicable** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Nonpharmacologic Interventions for the Prevention and/or Treatment of Postoperative Delirium in Older Surgical Patients 


Nonpharmacologic interventions were defined as including behavioral interventions, monitoring devices, rehabilitation, environmental adaptations, psychological and social supports, medication reductions, complementary and alternative medicine, and system and process changes. 


  1. **Education Targeted to Healthcare Professionals about Delirium**

#####  Recommendation 

Healthcare systems and hospitals should implement formal educational programs with ongoing formal and/or informal refresher sessions for healthcare professionals on delirium in at-risk older surgical adults to improve understanding of its epidemiology, assessment, prevention, and treatment ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low** ) 

  2. **Multicomponent Nonpharmacologic Interventions Performed by an Interdisciplinary Team for Prevention of Delirium**

#####  Recommendation 

Healthcare systems and hospitals should implement multicomponent nonpharmacologic intervention programs delivered by an interdisciplinary team (including physicians, nurses, and possibly other healthcare professionals) for the entire hospitalization in at-risk older adults undergoing surgery to prevent delirium ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate** ). 

  3. **Multicomponent Nonpharmacologic Interventions Performed by an Interdisciplinary Team for Management of Delirium**

#####  Recommendation 

Healthcare professionals should consider multicomponent interventions implemented by an interdisciplinary team in older adults diagnosed with postoperative delirium to improve clinical outcomes ( **strength of recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  4. **Identify and Manage Causes of Delirium**

#####  Recommendation 

The healthcare professional should perform a medical evaluation, make medication and/or environmental adjustments, and order appropriate diagnostic tests and clinical consultations after an older adult has been diagnosed with postoperative delirium to identify and manage underlying contributors to delirium ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  5. **Specialized Hospital Units**

#####  Recommendation 

There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against hospitals creating, and healthcare professionals using, specialized hospital units for the inpatient care of older adults with postoperative delirium to improve clinical outcomes ( **strength of recommendation: not applicable; quality of evidence: low** ). 





###  Pharmacologic Treatments/Interventions Used Perioperatively to Prevent Postoperative Delirium in Older Surgical Patients 


  6. **Anesthesia Depth**

#####  Recommendation 

The anesthesia practitioner may use processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors of anesthetic depth during intravenous sedation or general anesthesia of older patients to reduce postoperative delirium ( **strength of recommendation: insufficient evidence; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  7. **Regional Anesthesia**

#####  Recommendation 

A healthcare professional trained in regional anesthetic injection may consider providing regional anesthetic at the time of surgery and postoperatively to improve pain control and prevent delirium in older adults ( **strength of recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  8. **Analgesia**

#####  Recommendation 

Healthcare professionals should optimize postoperative pain control, preferably with nonopioid pain medications, to minimize pain in older adults to prevent delirium ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  9. **Avoidance of Inappropriate Medications**

#####  Recommendation 

The prescribing practitioner should avoid medications that induce delirium postoperatively in older adults to prevent delirium ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  10. **Antipsychotics Used Prophylactically to Prevent Delirium**

#####  Recommendation 

There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of antipsychotic medications prophylactically in older surgical patients to prevent delirium ( **strength of recommendation: not applicable; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  11. **Cholinesterase Inhibitors**

#####  Recommendation 

In older adults not currently taking cholinesterase inhibitors, the prescribing practitioner should not newly prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors perioperatively to older adults to prevent or treat delirium ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low** ). 





###  Pharmacologic Treatments/Interventions Used to Treat Postoperative Delirium in Older Surgical Patients 


  12. **Antipsychotics in the Setting of Severe Agitation**

#####  Recommendation 

The prescribing practitioner may use antipsychotics at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to treat patients who are severely agitated or distressed, and are threatening substantial harm to self and/or others. In all cases, treatment with antipsychotics should be employed only if behavioral interventions have failed or are not possible, and ongoing use should be evaluated daily with in-person examination of patients ( **strength of recommendation: weak; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  13. **Benzodiazepines**

#####  Recommendation 

The prescribing practitioner  should not  use benzodiazepines as a first-line treatment of the agitated postoperative delirious patient who is threatening substantial harm to self and/or others  to treat postoperative delirium except  when benzodiazepines are specifically indicated (including, but not limited to, treatment of alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal). Treatment with benzodiazepines should be at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration, and should be employed only if behavioral measures have failed or are not possible and ongoing use should be evaluated daily with in-person examination of the patient ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low** ). 

  14. **Pharmacologic Treatment of Hypoactive Delirium**

#####  Recommendation 

The prescribing practitioner  should not  prescribe antipsychotic or benzodiazepine medications for the treatment of older adults with postoperative delirium who are not agitated and threatening substantial harm to self or others ( **strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low** ).

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search**

The methods for the literature review included a combination of comprehensive searches, targeted searches, and specific, focused searches. The steps of the literature search are further outlined in the flow chart (Diagram 1) included in the full version of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Comprehensive searches of articles on the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the prevention or treatment of postoperative delirium in PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were conducted between August 1, 2013, and October 1, 2013, resulting in a total of 6,504 citations. The following search terms were included: _delirium_ , _organic brain syndrome_ , and _acute confusion_ , in combination with a variety of alternative terms for the prevention and treatment of delirium, including all variations of the words _prevention_ , _management_ , _treatment_ , _intervention_ , _therapy_ , _therapeutic_ , or _drug therapy_ (e.g., prevent, prevents, preventing, prevention, preventions, preventable). The limits placed on these searches included restricting the searches to adults, English only, and articles published from 1988 to the present.

Two targeted searches using the U.S. Library of National Medicine PubMed Special Queries on Comparative Effectiveness Research and PubMed Clinical Queries were also conducted. The search strategy conducted using the Special Queries on Comparative Effectiveness Research included the terms _delirium_ , _acute confusion_ , and _organic brain syndrome_ and returned a total of 2,173 studies, including 473 randomized clinical trials, 1,154 observational studies, and 546 systematic reviews. An additional 1,288 citations were identified through PubMed Clinical Queries using the term _postoperative delirium_.

There were multiple exclusion criteria, because the scope of this review was limited to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the prevention or treatment of peri-operative delirium. All studies related to topics other than prevention and treatment of delirium were excluded, including the pathophysiology, etiology, biomarkers, risk factors, predisposing factors, predictive models, prognostic methods or tools, and assessment (including screening, detection, recognition, identification, diagnosis, and rating scales). Any articles pertaining to delirium in nonadult populations (i.e., infants, children, adolescents) were excluded.

Other exclusion criteria included delirium due to alcohol or substance abuse withdrawal, psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia), dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), traumatic brain injury, emergence delirium, terminal illness, metabolic encephalopathy, or acute stroke. While many studies included persons with dementia or cognitive impairment, delirium-related studies including only or primarily persons with dementia were excluded. Delirium articles based primarily in settings other than the inpatient setting, including the emergency department, the ambulatory or outpatient setting, the community, postacute or long-term care (nursing homes), or hospice/palliative care settings were excluded. Even though palliative care settings were excluded, studies addressing palliative surgery or including patients undergoing palliative surgical procedures were included. Studies in which delirium occurred in patients having undergone neurologic or brain surgery were excluded. All types of publications other than observational studies or randomized clinical trials, including all nonsystematic reviews, comments, editorials, and letters, were excluded. Systematic reviews were utilized to verify completeness of the literature search.

Finally, to capture information on clinical trials that may have not been published, [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "ClinicalTrials.gov Web site") (a registry and results database of publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants conducted around the world) was searched. [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ "ClinicalTrials.gov Web site") searches included each of the following drugs: _quetiapine_ , _dexmedetomidine_ , _melatonin_ , _rivastigmine_ , _haloperidol_ , _gabapentin_ , _olanzapine_ , _donepezil_ , _risperidone_ , as well as the terms _analgesia_ , _delirium_ , and _confusion_. These searches were restricted to studies that were completed and that had results available; these searches were completed on November 26, 2013, and identified 357 studies.

All of the articles that met the inclusion criterion and that were not excluded for the reasons listed above were reviewed by the two panel co-chairs of this guideline project to determine appropriateness for inclusion in the review.

## Number of Source Documents



A total of 199 studies were used to create the evidence tables and 68 studies were used to rate guideline recommendations. Refer to the flow chart (Diagram 1) in the full version of the guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for an outline of the steps of the literature search.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Following a rigorous process, a team of four independent researchers prepared evidence tables and quality ratings for each study selected by the panel. The four researchers first underwent intensive training and standardization, each completing five initial ratings accompanied by standardization and retraining. For the entire review process, an expert re-rated all of the articles to assure reliability, and one of the panel co-chairs re-rated a 10% subsample. Questions and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The evidence tables included a summary of the study, as well as a quality rating and rating of the risk of bias. The quality rating system was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias and Jadad scoring system. The ratings were based on six key elements: evidence of balanced allocation, allocation concealment, blinded outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Following the Cochrane approach, each article was assigned a risk of bias rating as follows: low risk of bias indicated by low risk on all 6 domains, unclear risk indicated by high or unclear risk of bias on 1 or more of 6 domains, or high risk of bias indicated by high risk on 2 or more of 6 domains. In addition, each article was rated for the use of a validated delirium measure and sample size of 50 or more in each study arm. The citations for which evidence tables were created are denoted with ET in the text and "(ET)" in the bibliography and can be found in the full guideline (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Methods**

For this guideline, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) employed a well-tested framework for development of clinical practice guidelines. There were three components to the framework. First, an interdisciplinary expert panel on delirium was created. Second, a development process that included a systematic literature review and evaluation of the evidence by the expert panel was conducted. Third, the guideline document was written and revised initially through committee subgroups and subsequently achieved full consensus of the panel on all recommendation statements. Following manuscript preparation, external peer review was solicited, and an open public comment period was completed. The work for this guideline started with an initial consultation with an expert on guideline development and an author of the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) report on developing trustworthy guidelines. The IOM's reports on Systematic Reviews and Trustworthy Clinical Guideline provided the standards followed throughout our process and guided the framework.

**Panel Selection**

After initial nominations by the AGS and its Geriatrics-for-Specialists Initiative Council, the two panel cochairs screened prospective panel members with recognized expertise in relevant specialties and geriatrics, and recommended several more for inclusion. Other factors that influenced selection were the desire to have interdisciplinary representation and representation from different parts of the country. In addition to the 23-member panel, a representative from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), a quality and measures expert, and a caregiver representative were invited to serve as ex officio members. Represented disciplines on the interdisciplinary panel included the fields of geriatric medicine, general surgery, anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, geriatric surgery, gynecology, hospital medicine, neurology, nursing, orthopedic surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, palliative care, pharmacy, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, cardiothoracic surgery, urology, and vascular surgery.

**Selection of Clinical Topics**

Specific topics regarding postoperative delirium were selected to focus and guide the literature search. To select the topics, two interdisciplinary conference calls were held with specialists from geriatric medicine, general surgery, gynecology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesiology, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, thoracic surgery, urology, and physical medicine and rehabilitation. The specialists provided input as to the most critical deficiencies they perceived for postoperative delirium within their specialties. The comments from these calls were collated and provided the impetus for selection of the specific aims chosen for this guideline.

**Development Process**

Initial consensus was reached between the panel co-chairs and an independent researcher experienced in systematic literature reviews to define key search terms and to develop the protocol for the systematic review, including the search strategy, databases, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for the initial search. After the initial search, meetings were held to address questions of consistency, refinement of exclusion criteria, strategies for evaluating the evidence, and consolidation or expansion of individual search criterion. Abstracts of all articles captured by the initial search (>4,000) were reviewed by the panel co-chairs and two research associates. Every abstract was reviewed by at least two reviewers for inter-rater consistency in meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and consensus was reached. If there was any doubt about an article meeting criteria, the article was included. Articles meeting guideline inclusion criteria were then sorted by topic and provided to the full panel for consideration of inclusion or exclusion. A given article could be assigned to more than one topic.

The full panel then convened for a 2-day, in-person meeting early in the process, to review the initial results of the literature search and begin drafting recommendations. The panel was divided into five working groups aligned with each topic, each assigned in accordance with their specific area of expertise. Groups reviewed the abstracts assigned to their group and evaluated the following inclusion criteria: relevance to the topic, inclusion of original data (not review article), and exclusion of studies with gross methodologic limitations (case reports or sample sizes <20, lack of control group, risk factor study only). At least two reviewers were required to assess each abstract for this step; some articles were recategorized to different topic groups. The final abstract listing submitted by each working group provided the articles which were extracted into the evidence tables to be used for the actual recommendations. Based on the initial abstract review as well as expert judgment, the groups were asked to develop a preliminary listing of recommendations. Each group presented the group's preliminary recommendations to the full panel for feedback. After the meeting, each group met either via conference calls or through e-mail dialogue to resolve any questions, to add additional articles to the listing for evidence tables, and to refine the preliminary recommendation language.

The evidence tables and quality worksheets were then used by the panelist to independently rate the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation for each recommendation statement using the American College of Physicians' Guideline Grading System, which is based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) scheme developed previously (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields). Panelist ratings were compiled for each group and returned to that group, who then reached consensus via conference calls. All panelists were trained on the GRADE system using standard methods including print and online materials.

For some criteria, the panel provided a "strong" recommendation, even though the quality of evidence was low or moderate. In such cases, the strength of recommendation was based on balancing the benefits of treatment against the potential harms and required agreement by the entire panel. Strong recommendations were made when the benefit clearly outweighed harms (such as with nonpharmacologic interventions) or when the potential harms clearly outweighed the benefits (such as with benzodiazepine treatment). Weak recommendations were made when the panel judged the evidence to be in favor of these interventions, but the current level of evidence or potential risks of the treatment did not support a strong recommendation. The strength of recommendation was "insufficient" when the panel deemed that a recommendation statement should be made but weighed the evidence as being insufficient to determine the net risks and benefits.

The strength of recommendation was "not applicable" when no recommendation could be made, that is, the panel did not deem the evidence to weigh either for or against a clinical practice. The wording of each recommendation followed IOM recommendations. An additional one-day, in-person meeting was held to further discuss each recommendation's language and its quality of evidence, strength of recommendation, and potential harms. Following this meeting, feedback and edits were incorporated, and a final draft of the recommendations was reviewed and approved by the entire panel via conference call.

## Cost Analysis



Previous studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of multicomponent delirium intervention strategies even after consideration of these costs across different settings (general medical, geriatric, hip fracture, surgical, and intensive care unit [ICU] settings). The cost-effectiveness of educational interventions and specialized hospital units has not been evaluated previously. The costs of nonpharmacologic interventions may be offset by the considerable costs of delirium, estimated to exceed $164 billion per year (2011 USD) in the United States.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The draft statement was sent for peer-review at multiple organizations and edits were incorporated by the panel co-chairs. The statement also underwent a period of public commentary (3 weeks), as well as review by lay organizations representing older adults.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



The recommendation statements provide a framework to allow hospital systems and healthcare professionals to implement actionable, evidence-based measures to improve delirium prevention and treatment.

## Potential Harms



  * Risks of diagnostic tests and procedures, as well as the possibility of pain and infection. Overuse of neuroimaging (computed tomography [CT]/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is an additional potential risk. For agitated patients, sedation and/or restraints may be required to obtain these studies; however, both sedating medications and restraints may exacerbate delirium. 
  * The safety of conducting "light anesthesia" in patients who require general anesthesia has not been demonstrated. Lighter anesthesia may lead to several adverse events, including intraoperative recall or movement, sympathetic stimulation and adverse hemodynamic changes, particularly in older patients or in those with vascular disease. Use of processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors may cause the anesthesia practitioner to overfocus on a single clinical parameter. 
  * Complications of regional anesthesia, such as nerve injury, hematoma, intravascular injection, neurotoxicity, and cardiac toxicity are uncommon. 
  * Opioid analgesics carry risks of constipation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, sedation, impaired judgment, altered psychomotor function, rash, pruritus, and anaphylactic allergic reactions. Long-term opioid use can lead to dependence. Opioid dosing needs to be properly monitored, and patients must be managed for potential respiratory depression. Nonopioid medications such as gabapentin, paracetamol or acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents also have potential harms. 
  * Specific conditions may warrant use of medications that induce delirium postoperatively in older adults. For example, a patient with a history of alcohol abuse or chronic benzodiazepine usage may require treatment with a benzodiazepine to prevent withdrawal complications, or a patient may require treatment with diphenhydramine for a severe allergic or transfusion reaction. 
  * The potential harms associated with antipsychotic medications are numerous and include, but are not limited to, central nervous system effects (such as somnolence, extrapyramidal effects such as muscle rigidity, tremor, restlessness, swallowing difficulty, decreased seizure threshold, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome), systemic and cardiovascular effects (such as QT prolongation, dysrhythmias, sudden death, hypotension, and tachycardia), pneumonia, urinary retention, postural instability, falls, deep venous thrombosis, anticholinergic effects, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, and metabolic effects (such as weight gain, insulin resistance, and hypertriglyceridemia). Even short-term treatment is associated with increased mortality. The inadvertent chronic administration of antipsychotics after inpatient initiation during an episode of delirium is an important harm. One review found that 47% of patients continued to receive the drug after discharge from the intensive care unit and 33% as an outpatient after discharge from hospital, without a clear indication. 
  * Adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors include diarrhea, anorexia, dyspepsia, bradycardia, and potential to exacerbate peptic ulcer disease, cardiac conduction disorders, seizures, asthma, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Withholding cholinesterase inhibitors in patients on chronic treatment may cause worsening symptoms. 
  * The potential harms of not using benzodiazepines as first-line treatment of the agitated postoperative delirious patient include withholding treatment for conditions in which benzodiazepines are indicated, such as alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal. 
  * Patients with hypoactive delirium who may be experiencing hallucinations and delusions might get symptomatic relief from their experiences, even if the antipsychotic medications do not resolve the delirious episode. Hallucinatory and delusional experiences might be difficult to elicit from a hypoactive patient during the delirious episode, and withholding antipsychotic medications in this situation might be associated with increased suffering. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * This guideline is limited to the aims described in the original guideline document. Some of the recommendations will not apply to specific areas of care, such as intensive care unit (ICU) sedation, palliative care, and nursing home settings. Diagnosis and screening are not addressed in these guidelines. Other topics, such as prescription of melatonin to prevent delirium, were considered but not addressed due to a lack of evidence. Since delirium is a burgeoning area of clinical investigation, regular updates of the recommendations are planned as new evidence becomes available. 
  * This guideline has some important limitations including feasibility restrictions in completeness of the literature search, limited quality of available evidence, and extrapolation from studies conducted outside the surgical setting. Importantly, this guideline is not intended to supersede clinical judgment or individual patient preferences, and decisions must always be customized to the individual situation. Despite the limitations, the guideline follows a rigorous evidence-based approach guided by Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards for systematic review and guideline development, conducted by an interdisciplinary expert panel, and revised extensively based on commentary from stakeholders and the public. Ultimately, it is hoped that this guideline will help to improve clinical care, advance policy, and lay the groundwork for future discoveries in this important area to improve quality of life for older adults and their families.
