# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The grades of evidence (I-III) and levels of recommendation (A-C) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


**The following recommendation is based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B)** : 


  * The recommended treatment for lichen sclerosus is an ultrapotent topical corticosteroid, such as clobetasol propionate. 




**The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C)** : 


  * Biopsy of hyperpigmented or exophytic lesions, lesions with changes in vascular patterns, or unresolving lesions is particularly important and should be performed to rule out carcinoma. 
  * For patients with biopsy-confirmed Paget disease, further evaluation of the breast, genitourinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract should be undertaken. 




**_Definitions_ ** _:_


####  Grades of Evidence 


**I** Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial. 


**II-1** Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization. 


**II-2** Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case–control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group. 


**II-3** Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence. 


**III** Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees. 


####  Levels of Recommendation 


**Level A** — Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence. 


**Level B** — Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence. 


**Level C** — Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.

  2. Medical history
  3. Search for common vulvar irritants and allergens
  4. Vulvar biopsy
  5. Additional diagnostic tests (e.g., culture, microscopy, vaginal pH)



**Treatment and Management**

  1. Topical therapies 
    * Estrogen and testosterone creams
    * Topical steroid cream (clobetasol propionate)
    * Nonhormonal vaginal moisturizer
  2. Systemic immunosuppressive therapies
  3. Surgery
  4. Further evaluation of biopsy-confirmed Paget disease



## Major Outcomes Considered

  * Sexual function
  * Well-being



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



 **2008 Guideline**

The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' own internal resources and documents were used to conduct a literature search to locate relevant articles published between January 1985 and August 2007. The search was restricted to articles published in the English language. Priority was given to articles reporting results of original research, although review articles and commentaries also were consulted. Abstracts of research presented at symposia and scientific conferences were not considered adequate for inclusion in this document. Guidelines published by organizations or institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were reviewed, and additional studies were located by reviewing bibliographies of identified articles.

**2013 Reaffirmation**

The NCBI database was searched from 2008 to 2013. Committee members conducted a literature search with the assistance from the ACOG Resource Center staff who routinely perform the Practice Bulletin literature searches.

<p><strong>I</strong> Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</p>

<p><strong>II-1</strong> Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</p>

<p><strong>II-2</strong> Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case&#8211;control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.</p>

<p><strong>II-3</strong> Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence.</p>

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **2008 Guideline**

Analysis of available evidence was given priority in formulating recommendations. When reliable research was not available, expert opinions from obstetrician–gynecologists were used. See also the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Recommendations" field regarding Grade C recommendations.

**2013 Reaffirmation**

The Committee on Practice Bulletins - Gynecology met in March 2013 and reaffirmed this document. A committee member reviewed the document and new literature on the topic. The document was then reviewed by the committee and the committee agreed that it is current and accurate.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Based on the highest level of evidence found in the data, recommendations are provided and graded according to the following categories:

**Level A** — Recommendations are based on good and consistent scientific evidence.

**Level B** — Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence.

**Level C** — Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Practice Bulletins are validated by two internal clinical review panels composed of practicing obstetrician-gynecologists generalists and sub-specialists. The final guidelines are also reviewed and approved by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Executive Board.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see "Major Recommendations").

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of vulvar skin disorders

## Potential Harms



  * Side effects of: 
    * Topical estrogen therapy in girls
    * Topical steroid therapy
    * Systemic immunosuppressants
  * When compared in randomized controlled trials with either estrogen tablets or with the estrogen ring, conjugated equine estrogen cream was found to be significantly associated with adverse effects, including bleeding, breast pain, and perineal pain.
  * All forms of topical estrogen therapy increase the possibility of endometrial hyperplasia and overstimulation.
