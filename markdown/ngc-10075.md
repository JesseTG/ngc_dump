# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The evidence grades ( **A-D, X** ) and evidence-based statements ( **Strong Recommendation, Recommendation, Option,** and **No Recommendation** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


####  Statement 1. Patient History and Physical Examination 


Clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis. 


#####  Strong recommendation based on observational studies of alternative causes of facial paralysis and reasoning from first principles, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade C**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefit: Identification of other causes of facial paresis/paralysis, enabling accurate diagnosis; avoidance of unnecessary testing and treatment; identification of patients for whom other testing or treatment is indicated; opportunity for appropriate patient counseling 
  * Risks, harms, costs: None 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit 
  * Value judgments: The Guideline Development Group (GDG) felt that assessment of patients cannot be performed without a history and physical examination and that it would not be possible to find stronger evidence, as studies excluding these steps cannot ethically be performed. Other causes of facial paresis/paralysis may go unidentified; a thorough history and physical examination will help avoid missed diagnoses or diagnostic delay. 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **Strong recommendation**
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 2. Laboratory Testing 


Clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. 


#####  Recommendation (against) based on observational studies and expert opinion with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade C**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefit: Avoidance of unnecessary testing and/or treatment, avoidance of pursuing false positives, cost savings 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Potential missed diagnosis 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit 
  * Value judgments: While the GDG felt that there are circumstances where specific testing is indicated in at-risk patients (such as Lyme disease serology in endemic areas), these patients can usually be identified by history. 
  * Intentional vagueness: The GDG used the word _routine_ to specify that under certain circumstances, laboratory testing may be indicated. 
  * Role of patient preferences: Small (there is an opportunity for patient education) 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **Recommendation (against)**
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 3. Diagnostic Imaging 


Clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. 


#####  Recommendation (against) based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade C**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefit: Avoidance of unnecessary radiation exposure, avoidance of incidental findings, avoidance of contrast reactions, cost savings 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Risk of missing other cause of facial paresis/paralysis 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit 
  * Value judgments: None 
  * Intentional vagueness: The word _routine_ was used to indicate there may be some clinical findings that would warrant imaging. 
  * Role of patient preferences: Small, but there is an opportunity for patient education/counseling 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **Recommendation (against)**
  * Differences of opinion: None

  * Policy level: **Strong recommendation**
  * Differences of opinion: None 




**Statement 5A.** **Antiviral Monotherapy**


Clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. 


#####  Strong recommendation (against) based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade A**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefit: Avoidance of medication side effects, cost savings

Clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy. 


#####  Option based on randomized controlled trials with minor limitations and observational studies with equilibrium of benefit and harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade B**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, because the studies cannot exclude a small effect 
  * Benefit: Small potential improvement in facial nerve function 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Treatment side effects, cost of treatment 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm 
  * Value judgments: Although the data were weak, the risks of combination therapy were small 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: Large; significant role for shared decision making 
  * Exceptions: Diabetes, morbid obesity, and previous steroid intolerance. Pregnant women should be treated on an individualized basis

#####  Strong recommendation based on expert opinion and a strong clinical rationale with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade X**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High. Eye protection has been the standard of care, and comparative studies with a no-treatment arm are unethical 
  * Benefit: Prevention of eye complications 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Cost of eye protection implementation, potential side effects of eye medication 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: None 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: Small 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **Strong recommendation**
  * Differences of opinion: None

  * Policy Level: **Recommendation (against)**
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 7B. Electrodiagnostic Testing with Complete Paralysis 


Clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. 


#####  Option based on observational trials with equilibrium of benefit and harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade C**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium due to variations in patient selection, study design, and heterogeneous results 
  * Benefit: Provide prognostic information for the clinician and patient, identification of potential surgical candidates 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Patient discomfort, inconvenience to undergo repeated electrical testing, cost of testing 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm 
  * Value judgments: None 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: Large role for shared decision making, as electrodiagnostic testing may provide only prognostic information for the patient 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **Option**
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 8. Surgical Decompression 


No recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for Bell's palsy patients. 


#####  No recommendation based on low-quality, nonrandomized trials and equilibrium of benefit and harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade D**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Low due to insufficient number of patients and poor quality of studies. Low confidence in the evidence led to a downgrade of the aggregate evidence quality from C to D 
  * Benefit: Improved facial nerve functional recovery 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Surgical risks and complications, anesthetic risks, direct and indirect costs of surgery 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm 
  * Value judgments: Although the data supporting surgical decompression are not strong, there may be a significant benefit for a small subset of patients who meet eligibility criteria and desire surgical management. 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: Large. The psychological impact of facial paralysis is significant but varies among patients. Concern about the facial deformity may make some patients willing to pursue a major operation for a small increase in the chance of complete recovery, while others may be more willing to accept the chance of poorer outcome to avoid surgery. 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **No recommendation**
  * Differences of opinion: Major. The group was divided as to whether the evidence supported no recommendation or an option for surgery. This difference of opinion derived from controversy regarding the strength of evidence (C level evidence vs D level evidence). 




####  Statement 9. Acupuncture 


No recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in Bell's palsy patients. 


#####  No recommendation based on poor-quality trials and an indeterminate ratio of benefit and harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade B**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Low, due to significant methodological flaws in available evidence 
  * Benefit: Acupuncture may provide a potential small improvement in facial nerve function and pain 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Cost of acupuncture therapy, time required for therapy, therapy side effects, and delay in instituting steroid therapy 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Unknown 
  * Value judgments: Due to the poor quality of the data and the inability to determine the harm-to-benefit ratio, the GDG could not make a recommendation. 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: Large 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **No recommendation**
  * Differences of opinion: Major. The GDG was divided regarding whether to recommend against acupuncture or to make no recommendation 




####  Statement 10. Physical Therapy 


No recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in Bell's palsy patients. 


#####  No recommendation based on case series and equilibrium of benefit and harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade D**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Low, due to significant flaws in existing trials 
  * Benefit: Potential functional and psychological benefit 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Cost of therapy, time required for therapy 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Equilibrium of benefit and harm 
  * Value judgments: Patients may benefit psychologically from engaging in physical therapy exercises 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: Large role for shared decision making 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **No recommendation**
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 11. Patient Follow-up 


Clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: **Grade C**
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefit: Reevaluation for alternate diagnoses of facial paralysis, discussion of therapeutic/reconstructive options, psychological support of patient 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Cost of visit, time dedicated to visit 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: The GDG sought to address the importance of identifying alternate diagnoses in the absence of recovery and potential assessment for rehabilitative options. The GDG recognized a lack of established time for patient follow-up; however, based on the natural history of Bell's palsy, most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset. 
  * Intentional vagueness: Several specialties have the expertise to reevaluate these patients; therefore, the term _facial nerve specialist_ is used to indicate the clinician who could most appropriately assess new or worsening symptoms in these patients. 
  * Role of patient preferences: Small 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: **Recommendation**
  * Differences of opinion: None

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



All literature searches were performed by an information specialist through July 2012. Two initial searches were performed to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The searches were performed in multiple databases, including the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) ([www.guideline.gov](http://www.guideline.gov "NGC Web site")), The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects [DARE], Health Technology Assessment [HTA] Database, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database [NHS EED]), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE, PubMed, Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infobase, National Health Service (NHS) Evidence Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) and Audiology, National Library of Guidelines, National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (ANHMRC), the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Health Services/Technology Assessment Texts (HSTAT), and the TRIP database.

  1. Clinical practice guidelines were identified by a NGC, CMA Infobase, NHS Evidence ENT and Audiology, National Library of Guidelines, NICE, SIGN, NZGG, ANHMRC, TRIP database, G-I-N, and PubMed search using _guideline_ as a publication type or title word. The search identified 1 guideline after removing duplicates, clearly irrelevant references, and non –English-language articles. 
  2. Systematic reviews were identified through NHS Evidence ENT and Audiology, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, HTA Database, NHS EED), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, AHRQ, HSTAT, and the TRIP database. The final data set included 30 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that were distributed to the Guideline Development Group (GDG) members. Articles were excluded if they were not available in English and did not meet the GDG's quality criteria (i.e., the review had a clear objective and method, an explicit search strategy, and a valid method of data extraction). 
  3. RCTs were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL and totaled 49 trials. 



The following search parameters were used for both literature searches:

  * Scope: Acute onset of facial nerve paresis or paralysis (Bell's palsy) 
  * Population: Adults, children 
  * Exclusions: None 
  * Keywords: Bell's palsy, Bell palsy, acute facial paralysis, unilateral facial nerve paralysis/palsy, acute facial nerve paralysis/palsy, idiopathic facial nerve paralysis/palsy, bilateral facial nerve paralysis/palsy, recurrent facial nerve paralysis/palsy, acute facial paralysis and steroid use, acute facial paralysis, facial paresis and antiviral use, surgical management of Bell's palsy, surgical management of acute facial nerve paralysis, facial paralysis, and pregnancy. 



Results of all literature searches were distributed to GDG members, including electronic listings with abstracts (if available) of the searches for clinical guidelines, RCTs, systematic reviews, and other studies. This material was supplemented, as needed, with targeted searches to address specific needs identified in writing the guideline through February 2013.

## Number of Source Documents



  * 1 guideline 
  * 30 systematic reviews or meta-analyses

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined. Evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the statement is followed. The definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields.

As much of the guideline dealt with evidence relating to diagnostic tests, the definitions for Evidence Levels for Grades of Evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) was adapted to include current recommendations from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



This guideline was developed using an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) followed the protocol through all stages of the development process. The GDG consisted of 17 members representing otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, neurology, facial plastic and reconstructive surgery, neurotology, emergency medicine, primary care, otology, nursing, physician assistants, and consumer advocacy.

In a series of conference calls, the working group defined the scope and objectives of the proposed guideline. During the 10 months devoted to guideline development ending in February 2013, the GDG met twice, with in-person meetings following the format previously described, using electronic decision-support (BRIDGE-Wiz, Yale Center for Medical Informatics, Connecticut) software to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles. Internal electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft was used to ensure accuracy of content and consistency with standardized criteria for reporting clinical practice guidelines.

American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor (GLIA) to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. GDG members received summary appraisals in February 2013 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The final guideline draft underwent extensive external peer review. Comments were compiled and reviewed by the chair of the Guideline Development Group (GDG), and a modified version of the guideline was distributed and approved by the full GDG.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

The recommendations contained in the guideline are based on the best available data published through February 2013. Where data were lacking, a combination of clinical experience and expert consensus was used.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, the guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease inappropriate variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve paralysis and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.

For benefits of specific interventions considered in the guideline, see the "Major Recommendations" field.

## Potential Harms



 **Oral Corticosteroids**

Treatment of Bell's palsy with oral corticosteroids is not without risk. Known side effects of oral corticosteroid use include gastrointestinal disturbances, reactivation of peptic ulcer disease, loss of control of glucose levels, elevated blood pressure, peripheral edema, and mood swings or episodes of acute psychosis. Although rare, avascular necrosis of the femoral head has been reported. Pregnant patients and patients with diabetes were routinely excluded from randomized trials. Accordingly, these patients should be handled on an individualized basis.

**Antiviral Therapy**

  * The most commonly observed side effects of antiviral therapy are gastrointestinal related and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with rare severe reactions, including hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, and hepatic or renal failure. Adverse events from antiviral therapy were rarely reported in clinical trials of patients with Bell's palsy and were limited to gastrointestinal upset. Accordingly, no serious adverse events from antiviral therapy were noted in the Bell's palsy literature. 
  * Antiviral therapy may also carry an increased risk for pregnant patients. 



**Eye Care**

  * Potential harms of eye care include potential side effects of eye medication. 
  * Some authors have not recommended or have discouraged eye patching due to the risk of corneal damage from poor patient execution of the procedure. Clinicians who recommend either eye taping or patching should ensure that patients have been carefully instructed in proper execution. 



**Electrodiagnostic Testing**

Potential harms of electrodiagnostic testing include patient discomfort, and inconvenience to undergo repeated electrical testing.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * This guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities deemed most important by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) and is not intended to be a comprehensive guide for diagnosing and managing Bell's palsy. The recommendations outlined in this guideline are not intended to represent the standard of care for patient management, nor are the recommendations intended to limit treatment or care provided to individual patients. 
  * Guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment but rather may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" than might be expected with a "recommendation." "Options" offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Clinicians must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. 
  * This clinical practice guideline is provided for informational and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing Bell's palsy. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and it may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. 
  * As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions, but they are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates and do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in light of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. 
  * The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNSF) Foundation emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care, or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



**Implementation Considerations**

The clinical practice guideline is published as a supplement to _Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery_ , which will facilitate reference and distribution. A full-text version of the guideline will be accessible, free of charge, at <http://www.entnet.org>. In addition, all American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guidelines are now available via the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery application for smartphones and tablets. The guideline will be presented to AAO-HNSF members as a miniseminar at the AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting & OTO EXPO. Existing brochures and publication by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline's recommendations.

As a supplement to clinicians, an algorithm of the guideline's action statements has been provided in the original guideline document. The algorithm allows for a more rapid understanding of the guideline's action statements and can be adopted as a quick reference guide to support the implementation of these recommendations.
