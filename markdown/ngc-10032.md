# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The grading system for the strength of recommendations ( **1** or **2** ) and the levels of evidence ( **A** â€“ **C** ) is defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Routine Monitoring and Management 


####  Growth and Nutritional Rehabilitation 


  1. Optimize the nutritional status before and after liver transplantation (LT) ( **1B** ). 
  2. To encourage growth, routine immunosuppression protocols should minimize steroid exposure during the first 6 to 12 months after transplantation ( **1A** ). 
  3. Measure the height and weight to identify patients with growth impairment who may benefit from reduced steroid exposure ( **1B** ). 
  4. Monitor the body mass index and consider obesity management ( **2C** ). 




####  Endocrine and Bone Metabolism 


#####  Hepatic Osteodystrophy 


  5. Monitor patients for persistent hepatic osteodystrophy, risk factors for fractures, and scoliosis ( **1B** ). 
  6. Continue mineral and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation (especially D  2  , or D  3  ) until vitamin D levels are normal ( **1B** ). 




####  Psychosocial Development 


  7. The follow-up of school-aged LT recipients should include an assessment of school functioning and school absence ( **1A** ). 
  8. Be aware of posttraumatic stress disorder or other mental health issues and refer a patient for a formal psychiatric evaluation if significant symptoms are present ( **1B** ). 




####  Neurocognitive Function 


  9. Screen neurocognitive function before transplantation for LT candidates older than 5 years and at key junctures afterward to determine special education needs ( **1B** ). 
  10. Assess recipients for hearing loss in the first postoperative year and periodically thereafter as indicated ( **1B** ). 
  11. Provide rehabilitation immediately after transplantation: physical therapy for infants with delayed motor development and speech and occupational therapy for older children with deficits ( **1B** ). 




####  Adherence 


  12. The transplant team assesses and treats nonadherence with a multidisciplinary approach ( **2B** ). 
  13. Screen for nonadherence with objective methods such as the monitoring of immunosuppressant levels ( **1B** ). 




####  Screening and Detection of Late Surgical Complications 


  14. Surgical complications are optimally investigated and treated at a transplant center ( **2B** ). 




####  Protocol Liver Biopsy 


  15. Protocol liver biopsy 1 year after transplantation is not required ( **1B** ). 




####  Screening for Skin Cancer 


  16. Encourage protective clothing, regular screening for skin lesions, and sunscreen ( **1B** ). 




####  Safe Living 


  17. Minimize infection risks related to hygiene, food, water, animals/pets, and travel ( **2C** ). 
  18. Recipients can travel abroad 6 months after transplantation with normal precautions and the advice of their transplant center ( **2C** ). 
  19. Combat childhood infections with recombinant or killed vaccines ( **1A** ). 
  20. Immunize household contacts. Recipients and relatives should receive the annual influenza immunization ( **1B** ). 




###  Immunosuppression 


####  Acute Rejection (AR) 


  21. Serial measurements of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and immunosuppressant blood levels are the main means of detecting graft dysfunction and AR ( **1B** ) 
  22. A histological assessment of a liver biopsy sample remains the best means of diagnosing AR ( **1A** ). 




####  Chronic Rejection (CR) 


  23. CR is a major cause of late graft loss and should be considered in the setting of poorly responsive AR with biopsy findings supportive of CR ( **1A** ). 
  24. Treat CR with one of a variety of choices: use a higher serum level of the immunosuppressive (e.g., tacrolimus), switch to different immunosuppressives (e.g., from tacrolimus to mTOR inhibitors), and/or add other immunosuppressives (e.g., mycophenolate; **1B** ). 




####  Renal Function 


#####  Screening and Prevention 


  25. Regularly screen renal function with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and practice calcineurin minimization. Consider renal-sparing drugs when the calculated GFR is  <70 mL/minute/1.73 m  2  ( **1B** ). 




####  Diabetes Mellitus 


  26. Screen LT recipients older than 5 years annually with fasting glucose in the early post-LT period and during long-term follow-up. Diagnose and treat posttransplant diabetes mellitus with the current standardized criteria ( **1A** ). 




####  Cardiovascular Disease 


  27. Screen recipients annually for cardiovascular risks (body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting lipids) and treat them according to age specific guidelines. Consider modifying immunosuppression regimens ( **1B** ). 




####  Withdrawal of Immunosuppression 


  28. Corticosteroids may be withdrawn within 6 months of transplantation for patients who receive tacrolimus as their primary immunosuppression ( **1B** ). 
  29. For patients more than 1 year after transplantation with normal liver blood tests, maintain tacrolimus therapy with target immunosuppression levels  <6 ng/mL ( **1C** ). 
  30. More than 5 years after transplantation, immunosuppression minimization (defined as a calcineurin inhibitor [CNI] once daily) may be considered if there is no history of CR, liver tests are normal, and a biopsy sample shows minimal or no portal inflammation and less than stage 3 fibrosis ( **2C** ). 
  31. Complete immunosuppression withdrawal may be indicated if there are significant immune-related complications, but this should occur only within clinical trials ( **2C** ). 




###  Disease-specific Issues and Recurrent Disease 


  32. Be aware of the risk of recurrence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in children after transplantation and the need to continue steroids ( **1B** ). 
  33. Periodic screening for colon cancer after transplantation for PSC with colitis may be beneficial; the optimal intervals are unknown ( **2B** ). 
  34. A multidisciplinary approach to hepatoblastoma care involving oncology, radiology, hepatology, and surgery can improve posttransplant survival ( **2B** ). 
  35. Patients with cystic fibrosis require close multispecialist care after isolated LT, with particular attention paid to nutrition, lung function, and infectious risks ( **1A** ). 




###  Infections 


####  Late Viral Infections 


#####  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) 


  36. Diagnose with quantitative nucleic acid-based or CMV pp65 antigenemia viral load assays in patients with a compatible clinical syndrome ( **1A** ). 
  37. No specific prophylactic strategy is routinely indicated for CMV donor-negative/recipient-negative children, but the use of intravenous ganciclovir for all CMV donor-positive/recipient-negative recipients is recommended ( **1A** ). 
  38. The primary transplant center should coordinate the management of symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with detectable CMV polymerase chain reaction and/or rising titer CMV viral loads ( **1B** ). 
  39. Intravenous ganciclovir is recommended as the initial antiviral therapy; continue this until the CMV load becomes undetectable ( **2C** ). 
  40. Consider ganciclovir resistance in patients with refractory clinical symptoms or children with persistent/rising CMV loads despite at least 14 days of antiviral therapy. Consider genotypic testing for resistance mutations and second-line therapies (foscarnet and cidofovir; **1B** ). 




#####  Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) 


  41. Determine the EBV serostatus of recipients and donors to identify patients at high risk for PTLD ( **1B** ). 
  42. Seronegative patients before transplantation should be screened with EBV viral loads annually afterward to determine their susceptibility to a primary infection. Screen recipients at increased risk for EBV disease (donor-positive/recipient-negative) and PTLD weekly or biweekly during the first year after transplantation ( **1B** ). 
  43. Patients presenting with typical symptoms such as persistent fever and lymphadenopathy should be clinically evaluated for PTLD with histopathology and EBV viral loads. Those with rising EBV viral loads should be discussed with their transplant center; management might include reduced immunosuppression and/or specific therapy ( **1B** ). 




####  Community-acquired Respiratory Viruses 


  44. Immunize recipients against community-acquired viruses (influenza A, B) annually. No guidance exists for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis ( **1B** ). 




#####  Pneumocystis jirovecii 


  45. Give at least 6 months' prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( **1B** ). 




###  Adolescent Issues 


####  Risk Behavior 


  46. All adolescent girls should receive advice about fertility, contraception, and safe immunosuppression during pregnancy and should avoid mycophenolate ( **2B** ). 
  47. All girls with menstrual problems should be reviewed by a gynecologist for advice and management ( **2C** ). 
  48. Transfer adolescents who become pregnant to adult care to manage their immunosuppression ( **2B** ). 
  49. Inquire about prospective health insurance at the age of 17 to 19 years (depending on the locale; **2B** ). 
  50. Discuss the avoidance of substance abuse and smoking, advise minimal alcohol intake, and review risky behaviors annually ( **2C** ). 




####  Transition to Adult Care 


  51. The transition process is multidisciplinary and should begin around the age of 10 to 11 years according to developmental maturity ( **2B** ). 
  52. Prepare a standard transition protocol involving pediatric and adult providers ( **2B** ). 
  53. Before the transfer, achieve readiness by building the patient's understanding of the illness, self-management skills, and ability to assume responsibility over his or her care ( **2B** ). 
  54. Identify an adult care group to work closely with the transferring pediatrician and the patient for at least 1 year before the transfer ( **2C** ).

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate and effective long-term medical management of the pediatric patient after liver transplantation

## Potential Harms



  * Two-thirds of late deaths can be attributed to complications of immunosuppression, infections, and malignancies. Immunosuppression medications are associated with an increased risk for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Long-term immunosuppression treatment incurs substantial complications. The minimization or withdrawal of immunosuppression should be managed cautiously to prevent allograft damage. 
  * Early infectious complications tend to be related to surgical manipulations, technical complications of the surgery, and catheters and other foreign bodies. Intermediate infections are more attributable to immunosuppression, which risks infections with opportunistic pathogens (cytomegalovirus [CMV] and _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ ) as well as potentially severe disease from community-acquired pathogens (respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses). Children with uncorrected surgical complications (bile duct stenosis and obstructions) may suffer recurrent bacterial disease. 
  * Avascular necrosis is a complication of high-dose steroid treatments and has been reported in 7 of 196 solid organ transplant recipients (3.6%) 9.2 years after transplantation. 
  * Complications of liver biopsy are relatively rare, but 2% to 5% of children may have a significant complication (usually postbiopsy bleeding). 
  * Other adverse effects of treatments include hirsutism, obesity, and gingival hyperplasia. 
  * Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), the principal immunosuppressive medications used to prevent graft rejection, contribute to de novo acute and chronic posttransplant renal dysfunction. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications


  * If treatment is required for late hepatic artery thrombosis, thrombolysis and anticoagulation are rarely effective, and surgical reconstruction is contraindicated. 
  * Chronic rejection (CR), hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) or portal vein thrombosis (PVT) may contraindicate a repair of incisional hernia. 
  * Live attenuated vaccines are generally contraindicated after transplantation. Varicella vaccination is not recommended in children receiving long-term immunosuppression. 
  * All adolescent girls should avoid mycophenolate.
