###  Comprehensive Pediatric Eye and Vision Examination 


####  Examination Procedures* 


**Consensus-Based Action Statement** : A comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination should include, but is not limited to: 


  * Review of the nature and history of the presenting problem, patient and family eye and medical histories, including visual, ocular, general health, leisure and sports activities, and developmental and school performance history of the child 
  * Measurement of visual acuity 
  * Determination of refractive status 
  * Assessment of binocular vision, ocular motility, and accommodation 
  * Evaluation of color vision (baseline or periodic, if needed, for qualification purposes or if disease related) 
  * Assessment of ocular and systemic health, including evaluation of pupillary responses, anterior and posterior segment, peripheral retina, evaluation/measurement of intraocular pressure, and visual field testing. 




Refer to section III. Care Process, A. 9 in the original guideline document for a listing of potential benefits and harms of testing. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of all of the tests and/or assessments included in this recommendation. 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementation of this recommendation is likely to result in the enhanced ability to diagnose any eye or vision problems in infants and children. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




***Note** : See Appendix Tables 1, 2, and 3 in the original guideline document for a listing of specific tests by age group. 


####  Testing 


#####  Testing of Preschool Children (3 through 5 years of age) 


######  Refraction 


**Consensus-Based Action Statement** : Cycloplegic retinoscopy is the preferred procedure for the first evaluation of preschoolers. It is necessary to quantify significant refractive error in the presence of visual conditions such as strabismus, amblyopia, and anisometropia. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementation of this recommendation is likely to enhance the ability to evaluate and diagnose eye and vision problems in school-age children. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




#####  Testing of School-Age Children (6 through 18 years of age) 


######  Refraction 


**Consensus-based Action Statement** : Cycloplegic retinoscopy is the preferred procedure for the first evaluation of school-age children. It is necessary to quantify significant refractive error in the presence of visual conditions such as strabismus, amblyopia, and anisometropia. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementation of this recommendation is likely to enhance the ability to evaluate and diagnose eye and vision problems in school-age children. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




######  Color Vision 


**Consensus-Based Action Statement** : Abnormal color vision can affect daily performance of activities involving color discrimination and may interfere with or prevent some occupational choices later in life. Children should be tested as soon as possible for color vision deficiency and the parents/caregivers of children identified with color vision deficiency should be counseled. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementation of this recommendation is likely to increase early detection of color vision deficiency and alert parents/caregivers to any potential effects on a child's education or occupational choices. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




####  Supplemental Testing 


#####  Testing for Learning-Related Vision Problems 


**Consensus-Based Action Statement** : Children at risk for learning-related vision problems should be evaluated by a doctor of optometry. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementation of this recommendation is likely to result in more in-depth evaluation and diagnosis of children with learning-related vision problems. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




####  Children with Special Needs 


#####  Developmental Disabilities 


**Consensus-Based Action Statement** : Many children with developmental or intellectual disabilities have undetected and untreated vision problems and should receive a comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementation of this recommendation is likely to result in improved quality of life and educational and occupational achievement for these high-risk children. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




###  Management 


####  Counseling and Education 


**Consensus-Based Action Statement** : At the conclusion of a comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination, the diagnosis should be explained to the patient/parent/caregiver and related to the patient's symptoms, and a treatment plan and prognosis discussed. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementing this recommendation is likely to increase patient/parent/caregiver understanding of any diagnosed eye or vision problems and improve compliance with any recommended treatment. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




#####  Eye and Safety Protection 


**Evidence-Based Action Statement** : Parents/caregivers and children should be educated about potential risks for eye injuries at home, at school, and during sports and recreational activities, and advised about safety precautions to decrease the risk of ocular injury (Pollard, Xiang,  & Smith, 2012; Lesniak et al., 2012). Prevention of eye injuries in children should focus on the use of protective eyewear, parental supervision, and include education about both the risks of eye injury and the benefits of protective eyewear (Armstrong et al., 2013). 


  * **Evidence Quality** : **Grade B** : Retrospective cohort studies 
  * **Level of Confidence** : Medium 
  * **Clinical Recommendation Strength** : **Strong Recommendation** . This recommendation should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. 
  * **Evidence Statements** : 
    * It is important to discuss eye safety issues with children/parents/caregivers. ( **Evidence Grade: B** ) 
    * Prevention strategies should focus on the use of protective eyewear, parental supervision, and on childhood education about both the risks of eye injury and the utility of protective eyewear. ( **Evidence Grade: B** ) 
  * **Potential Benefits** : Reduction in eye injuries in children 
  * **Potential Risks/Harms** : None 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Benefits significantly outweigh harms 
  * **Potential Costs** : Direct cost of counseling as part of a pediatric eye and vision examination 
  * **Value Judgments** : None 
  * **Role of Patient Preferences** : Large 
  * **Intentional Vagueness** : Specific type/form of counseling is not stated, as it is patient specific 
  * **Gaps in Evidence** : Research is needed to determine the risks and methods of eye protection associated with specific eye injuries in children in order to design appropriate prevention strategies 




#####  Ultraviolet Radiation and Blue Light Protection 


**Consensus-Based Action Statement** : All children and their parents/caregivers should be advised about the benefits of the regular use of sunglasses and/or clear prescription glasses that effectively block at least 99% of ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, the use of hats with brims when outdoors, and the importance of not looking directly at the sun. 


  * **Evidence Quality** : There is a lack of published research to support or refute the use of this recommendation. 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Implementing this recommendation is likely to decrease patient risk of eye health problems from acute or chronic exposure to UV radiation and blue light. The benefits of this recommendation were established by expert consensus opinion. 




#####  Impacts of Near Work and Reduced Time Outdoors on Vision 


**Evidence-Based Action Statement** : Patients/parents/caregivers should be counseled about the benefits to children's vision of spending more time outdoors (Gwiazda et al., 2014; Jones-Jordan et al., 2011; Jones-Jordan et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2014). 


  * **Evidence Quality** : **Grade B** . Randomized clinical trial, Prospective cohort studies, Cross-sectional study 
  * **Level of Confidence** : Medium 
  * **Clinical Recommendation Strength** : **Recommendation** . This recommendation should generally be followed, but remain alert for new information. 
  * **Evidence Statements** : 
    * More time spent outdoors and less time indoors doing near work may slow axial elongation and prevent high myopia thereby reducing the risk of developing sight-threatening conditions such as retinal detachment and myopic retinopathy. ( **Evidence Grade: A** ) 
    * More time outside may decrease myopia progression. Less outdoor/sports activity before myopia onset may exert a stronger influence on the development of myopia than near work. ( **Evidence Grade: B** ) 
    * Outdoor time and near work do not have a major effect on myopia progression. ( **Evidence Grade: B** ) 
    * Higher levels of outdoor activity were associated with lower amounts of myopia in primary school students. ( **Evidence Grade: D** ) 
  * **Potential Benefits** : Implementation of this recommendation is likely to help reduce the development and progression of myopia in children 
  * **Potential Risks/Harms** : None 
  * **Benefit and Harm Assessment** : Benefits significantly outweigh harms 
  * **Potential Costs** : Direct cost of counseling as part of a pediatric eye and vision examination and parental/caregiver time off from work 
  * **Value Judgments** : None 
  * **Role of Patient Preferences** : Moderate 
  * **Intentional Vagueness** : Specific type/form of counseling is not stated, as it is patient specific 
  * **Gaps in Evidence** : Research is needed on the effects and possible interaction of outdoor activity and near work on myopia in children

####  Strength of Clinical Recommendation Levels 


**Strong Recommendation** : The benefits of the recommendation clearly exceed the harms (or the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B). In some clearly identified circumstances, a strong recommendation may be made on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms. 


#####  This recommendation should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. 


**Recommendation** : The benefits of the recommendation exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C). In some clearly identified circumstances, a recommendation may be made on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms. 


#####  This recommendation should generally be followed, but remain alert for new information. 


**Option** : The benefits of the recommendation exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is low (Grade D) or well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage of one approach versus another. In some clearly identified circumstances, an option may be elevated to a recommendation even with lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms. 


#####  There should be an awareness of this recommendation, but a flexibility in clinical decision-making, as well as remaining alert for new information.

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



This guideline was developed by the American Optometric Association (AOA) Evidence-Based Optometry Guideline Development Group (GDG). Clinical questions to be addressed in the guideline were identified and refined during an initial meeting of the GDG and served as the basis for a search of the clinical and research literature.

An English language search of the medical literature for the eye and vision examination of children birth through 18 years of age, for the time period January 2005 through October 2016 was conducted by trained researchers. If the search did not produce results, the search parameters were extended an additional 5 years.

**Search Inclusion Criteria** (must meet all):

  1. English Studies 
  2. Study addresses the clinical question(s) 
  3. Paper meets the age group being addressed (0 to 18 years for pediatrics) 
  4. Searched by question(s) formulated at the AOA Call to Question Meeting attended by the GDG 
  5. Using all similar and relevant terms as defined by the GDG 



**Exclusion Criteria** (meeting _any_ of the below):

  1. Non-English studies 
  2. Animal studies 
  3. Studies outside of the patient age range 
  4. Studies not addressing any topic of the clinical questions searched 



In addition, a review of selected earlier research publications was conducted based on previous versions of this guideline. The literature search was conducted using the following electronic databases:

  * Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 
  * American Academy of Optometry (AAO) 
  * American Academy of Neurology 
  * American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS) 
  * American Journal of Optometry and Physiological Optics 
  * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics 
  * Cochrane Library 
  * Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) 
  * Elsevier 
  * Epidemiology 
  * Google Scholar 
  * JAMA Ophthalmology 
  * Journal of Adolescent Health Care (JAHC) 
  * Medline Plus 
  * National Eye Institute 
  * National Institute of Health Public Access (NIH) 
  * National Guideline Clearinghouse 
  * Neurology 
  * Ophthalmic Epidemiology 
  * Ophthalmology 
  * PubMed 
  * Other medical journals meeting the search criteria will be included in this list when used 



See the "Literature Search Process" document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for search terms.

All references meeting the criteria were reviewed to determine their relevance to the clinical questions addressed in the guideline.

## Number of Source Documents



A told of 251 background and graded references were used in the guideline, which yielded 6 evidence-based action statements, 9 consensus-based action statements, and 9 clinical notes and statements.

See the flow chart in Section VI of the original guideline document for details of the article selection process.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Each article was assigned to two clinicians who independently reviewed and graded the quality of evidence and the clinical recommendations derived from the article, based on a previously defined system for grading quality (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). If discrepancies were found in the grading results, the article was assigned to an independent third reader for review and grading.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



This guideline was developed by the American Optometric Association (AOA) Evidence-Based Optometry Guideline Development Group (GDG). Clinical questions to be addressed in the guideline were identified and refined during an initial meeting of the GDG and served as the basis for a search of the clinical and research literature.

During six articulation meetings (three face-to-face and three using a Webex platform) of the Evidence-Based Optometry Guideline Development Reading Group (GDRG), all evidence was reviewed and clinical recommendations were developed. The strength level of clinical recommendations was based on the quality grade of the research and the potential benefits and harms of the procedure or therapy recommended. Where high-quality evidence to support a recommendation was weak or lacking, a group consensus was required to approve any consensus recommendations.

Clinical recommendations in this guideline are evidence-based statements regarding patient care that are supported by the scientific literature or consensus of professional opinion when no quality evidence was discovered.

See the original guideline document for "AOA's 14 Steps to Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline Development" for a description of all steps involved in guideline development.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Strength of Clinical Recommendation Levels**

**Strong Recommendation** : The benefits of the recommendation clearly exceed the harms (or the harms clearly exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B). In some clearly identified circumstances, a strong recommendation may be made on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms.

_This recommendation should be followed unless clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present._

**Recommendation** : The benefits of the recommendation exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C). In some clearly identified circumstances, a recommendation may be made on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms.

_This recommendation should generally be followed, but remain alert for new information._

**Option** : The benefits of the recommendation exceed the harms (or the harms exceed the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation) but the quality of evidence is low (Grade D) or well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage of one approach versus another. In some clearly identified circumstances, an option may be elevated to a recommendation even with lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms.

_There should be an awareness of this recommendation, but a flexibility in clinical decision-making, as well as remaining alert for new information._

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Review and editing of the draft guideline by the Evidence-Based Optometry Guideline Development Group (GDG) required one face-to-face meeting and three additional Draft Reading Meetings using a Webex platform. The final Peer Review draft was reviewed and approved by the GDG by conference call, then made available for peer and public review for 30 days for numerous stakeholders (individuals and organizations). Comments were promoted and encouraged. All suggested revisions were reviewed and, if accepted by the GDG, incorporated into the guideline. All peer and public comments and all actions (and inactions) were recorded.

The guideline was approved by the American Optometric Association Board of Trustees on February 12, 2017.

See the original guideline document for "AOA's 14 Steps to Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline Development" for a description of all steps involved in drafting and reviewing the guideline document.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



 **Potential Benefits of Testing**

The potential benefits of a comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination include:

  * Optimizing visual function through diagnosis, treatment, and management of refractive, ocular motor, accommodative, and binocular vision problems 
  * Preventing and/or minimizing vision loss through early diagnosis, treatment, and management of ocular health conditions 
  * Detecting systemic disease and referring for appropriate care 
  * Counseling and educating patients/parents/caregivers on current conditions and preventive care to maintain ocular and systemic health and visual function, and on the relationship between vision problems and early learning 



See also the "Potential Benefits" sections in the "Major Recommendations" field for specific benefits of evidence-based recommendations.

## Potential Harms



 **Potential Harms of Testing**

Potential harms associated with a comprehensive pediatric eye and vision examination may include:

  * Patient or parent/caregiver anxiety about testing procedures or resulting diagnosis 
  * Adverse ocular and/or systemic reactions and/or temporary visual disturbances resulting from testing, or allergic responses to diagnostic pharmaceutical agents or materials used 
  * Missed or misdiagnosis of eye health or vision problems 
  * Unnecessary referral or treatment 



See also the "Potential Risks/Harms" sections in the "Major Recommendations" field for specific risks or harms for evidence-based recommendation.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Recommendations made in this guideline do not represent a standard of care. Instead, the recommendations are intended to assist the clinician in the decision-making process. Patient care and treatment should always be based on a clinician's independent professional judgment, given the patient's circumstances, and in compliance with state laws and regulations.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



Effective multifaceted implementation strategies targeting all relevant populations affected by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) should be employed by implementers to promote adherence to trustworthy guidelines.

American Optometric Association (AOA) Process:

  * The AOA Health Promotions Committee is responsible for the released guideline's translation into care. They promote the guideline on the AOA Web site, through the media, to AOA State Affiliates, optometric schools and colleges, Facebook and Twitter. 
  * They also produce a lecture slide series to be given at state, regional and national meetings where doctors and other caregivers gather for continuing education. 



Guideline developers should structure the format, vocabulary, and content of CPGs (e.g., specific statements of evidence, the target population) to facilitate ready implementation of computer-aided clinical decision support (CDS) by end-users.

AOA Process:

  * The Guideline Development Group includes a patient and a patient advocate representative to assist in guideline writing for optimum patient and public understanding. 
  * The guideline posting to the AOA Web site ([www.AOA.org](https://www.aoa.org/?sso=y "AOA Web site")) is made available to the public and is an electronic format that can be magnified for easier viewing. 
  * The guideline is also available in pdf format and is sent out upon request.
