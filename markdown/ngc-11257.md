## Major Recommendations



The levels of evidence and the grades of recommendations ( **1A-2C** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Preoperative Interventions 


####  Preadmission Counseling 


  1. A preoperative discussion of milestones and discharge criteria should typically be performed with the patient before surgery. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C.**
  2. Ileostomy education, marking, and counseling on dehydration avoidance should be included in the preoperative setting. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**




####  Preadmission Nutrition and Bowel Preparation 


  1. A clear liquid diet may be continued  <2 hours before general anesthesia. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A.**
  2. Carbohydrate loading should be encouraged before surgery in nondiabetic patients. **Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.**
  3. Mechanical bowel preparation plus oral antibiotic bowel preparation before colorectal surgery is the preferred preparation and is associated with reduced complication rates. **Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.**




####  Preadmission Optimization 


  1. Prehabilitation before elective surgery may be considered for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery with multiple comorbidities or significant deconditioning. **Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.**




####  Preadmission Orders 


  1. Preset orders should be used as a part of the enhanced care pathway. **Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C.**




###  Perioperative Interventions 


####  Surgical Site Infection 


  1. A bundle of measures should be in place to reduce surgical site infection. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**




####  Pain Control 


  1. A multimodal, opioid-sparing, pain management plan should be used and implemented before the induction of anesthesia. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**
  2. Thoracic epidural analgesia is recommended for open colorectal surgery, but not for routine use in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**




####  Perioperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) 


  1. Antiemetic prophylaxis should be guided by preoperative screening for risk factors for postoperative nausea/vomiting. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B.**
  2. Preemptive, multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis should be used in all at-risk patients to reduce PONV. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A.**




####  Intraoperative Fluid Management 


  1. Maintenance infusion of crystalloids should be tailored to avoid excess fluid administration and volume overload. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**
  2. Balanced chloride-restricted crystalloid solutions should be used as maintenance infusion in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C.**
  3. In high-risk patients and in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery associated with significant intravascular losses, the use of goal-directed fluid therapy is recommended. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**




####  Surgical Approach 


  1. A minimally invasive surgical approach should be used whenever the expertise is available and appropriate. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A.**
  2. The routine use of intra-abdominal drains and nasogastric tubes for colorectal surgery should be avoided. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**




###  Postoperative Interventions 


####  Patient Mobilization 


  1. Early and progressive patient mobilization is associated with shorter length of stay. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C.**




####  Ileus Prevention 


  1. Patients should be offered a regular diet immediately after elective colorectal surgery. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**
  2. Sham feeding (i.e., chewing sugar-free gum for ≥10 minutes 3 to 4 times per day) after colorectal surgery is safe, results in small improvements in gastrointestinal (GI) recovery, and may be associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1B.**
  3. Alvimopan is recommended to hasten recovery after open colorectal surgery, although its use in minimally invasive surgery remains less clear. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**




####  Postoperative Fluid Management 


  1. Intravenous fluids should be discontinued in the early postoperative period after recovery room discharge. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**




####  Urinary Catheters 


  1. Urinary catheters should be removed within 24 hours of elective colonic or upper rectal resection when not involving a vesicular fistula, irrespective of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) use. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**
  2. Urinary catheters should be removed within 48 hours of midrectal/lower rectal resections. **Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.**

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The details of specific search strategies, including search terms, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, total number of studies identified, and tables of evidence for each statement, are available in the supplements, but all of the search strategies involved an organized search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews using a variety of key word combinations (for details on key words and search strategies see Supplementary Document 1 [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Systematic searches were conducted from 1990 to March 2016 and were restricted to English-language articles. Directed searches of the embedded references from the primary articles were also performed in certain circumstances. Prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses were given preference in developing these guidelines.

## Number of Source Documents



After all of the searches were complete, a total of 12,483 citations had been identified for title/abstract review, and 764 articles were selected for extensive review and placed into evidence tables.

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

- Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p>See the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.</p></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Articles were selected for extensive review and placed into evidence tables with ranking of the evidence based on quality of the research by 2 independent reviewers (see Tables S1–S14 in the Supplemental Tables [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



These guidelines were built following a standardized algorithm for the creation of all of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines, which included: search for existing guidelines, formulation of key questions, a systematic review of the literature, selection and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, development of clear recommendations, and drafting of the guideline.

The final grade of recommendation was performed using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system outlined previously by the American College of Chest Physicians (see Table 1 in the original guideline document).

## Cost Analysis



Published cost analyses were reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Members of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) Practice Guidelines Committee worked in joint production of these guidelines from inception to final publication. Final recommendations were approved by each society's committee and executive council.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



A 2011 Cochrane review found that enhanced recovery protocols (ERPs) were associated with a reduction in overall complications and length of stay when compared with conventional perioperative patient management. Subsequent studies have shown that ERPs are associated with reduced healthcare costs and improved patient satisfaction. ERPs are also associated with improved outcomes regardless of whether patients undergo laparoscopic or open surgery. Studies have also shown that ERPs cannot simply be implemented and forgotten but require a continued audit process in place to guide compliance and to continue to improve quality.

Refer to the original guideline document for benefits associated with specific interventions.

## Potential Harms



  * Experimental and observational clinical studies have shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of anastomotic leakage. 
  * Systemic perioperative gabapentinoids, ketamine, and α2-agonists have also been administered to improve analgesia and reduce systemic opioid consumption and postoperative hyperalgesia, but psychotropic adverse effects, dizziness, and sedation may impair immediate recovery. Moreover, the optimal gabapentinoids regimen (dose, timing, and duration of administration) still needs to be determined. 
  * Trials and meta-analyses have shown that thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has no impact on or may even delay hospital discharge in laparoscopic surgery. This delay is probably related to the higher incidence of hypotension and urinary tract infections requiring additional postoperative care. 
  * With early oral feeding, providers must be cognizant that the risk of vomiting increases. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



This clinical practice guideline is based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made rather than to dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, healthcare workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed toward obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.
