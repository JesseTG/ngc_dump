## Guideline Status



This is the current release of the guideline.

# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Adverse events are inherent in the performance of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-fine-needle aspiration (FNA). As these procedures assume larger roles in the management of gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI disorders, the potential for adverse events will likely increase. Knowledge of potential adverse events secondary to EUS and EUS-FNA, their expected frequency, and their associated risk factors may help to minimize their occurrence. Endoscopists are expected to carefully select patients for the appropriate intervention, be familiar with the planned procedure and available technology, and be prepared to manage any adverse events that may arise. Once an adverse event occurs, early recognition and prompt intervention may minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with that adverse event. Review of adverse events as part of a continuing quality improvement process may serve to educate endoscopists, help to reduce the risk of future adverse events, and improve the overall quality of endoscopy.

## Guideline Objective(s)



To provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and increase knowledge of potential adverse events of these procedures

## Target Population



Patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS with fine-needle aspiration (FNA)

## Interventions and Practices Considered



  1. Awareness of potential adverse events associated with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA), their expected frequency, and the risk factors associated with their occurrence 
  2. Careful patient selection 
  3. Familiarity with the planned procedure and available technology 
  4. Preparation for and management of any adverse events 
  5. Review of complications to reduce future risk and improve overall quality 



## Major Outcomes Considered


  * Reduction of future adverse events 
  * Quality improvement 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



A search of the medical literature was performed by using PubMed. Additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When few or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results of large series and reports from recognized experts.

The time frame for all searches was January 1990 to January 2013.

## Qualifying Statements



  * This document is based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus at the time that the document was drafted. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of this document. This document may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. 
  * This document is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This document is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action. Therefore, clinical considerations may lead an endoscopist to take a course of action that varies from this document.
