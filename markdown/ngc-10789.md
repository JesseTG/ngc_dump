# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the strength of evidence ( **Class I-III** ) and strength of recommendations ( **Level A-C** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


  1. **Is intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) safe and effective for patients with acute ischemic stroke if given within 3 hours of symptom onset?**

#####  Level A recommendations. None speciﬁed. 

#####  Level B recommendations. With a goal to improve functional outcomes, IV tPA should be offered and may be given to selected patients with acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours after symptom onset at institutions where systems are in place to safely administer the medication. The increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) should be considered when deciding whether to administer IV tPA to patients with acute ischemic stroke. 

#####  Level C recommendations. When feasible, shared decisionmaking between the patient (and/or his or her surrogate) and a member of the health care team should include a discussion of potential beneﬁts and harms prior to the decision whether to administer IV tPA for acute ischemic stroke. (Consensus recommendation). 

  2. **Is IV tPA safe and effective for patients with acute ischemic stroke treated between 3 to 4.5 hours after symptom onset?**

#####  Level A recommendations. None speciﬁed. 

#####  Level B recommendations. Despite the known risk of sICH and the variability in the degree of beneﬁt in functional outcomes, IV tPA may be offered and may be given to carefully selected patients with acute ischemic stroke within 3 to 4.5 hours after symptom onset at institutions where systems are in place to safely administer the medication. 

#####  Level C recommendations. When feasible, shared decision making between the patient (and/or his or her surrogate) and a member of the health care team should include a discussion of potential beneﬁts and harms prior to the decision whether to administer IV tPA for acute ischemic stroke. (Consensus recommendation)

####  Strength of Recommendations 


Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines: 


**Level A recommendations** . Generally accepted principles for patient care that reﬂect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies). 


**Level B recommendations** . Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies). 


**Level C recommendations.** Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation. 


There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations. 
## Clinical Algorithm(s)

  * Is intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) safe and effective for patients with acute ischemic stroke if given within 3 hours of symptom onset? 
  * Is IV tPA safe and effective for patients with acute ischemic stroke treated between 3 to 4.5 hours after symptom onset? 



## Target Population



Adult patients aged 18 years and older presenting to the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke

**Note** : This guideline is not intended to be used for pediatric or pregnant patients.

## Interventions and Practices Considered



  1. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) administered within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset 
  2. Shared decision making between the patient (and/or his or her surrogate) and a member of the health care team

  * Functional outcomes (as measured by modified Rankin Scale scores) 
  * Mortality rates 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



This clinical policy was created after careful review and critical analyses of the medical literature and was based on a systematic review of the literature. Searches of MEDLINE, MEDLINE InProcess and other nonindexed citations portion of MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database were performed. All searches were limited to English-language sources, human studies, and adults, from January 2011 to September 2014; searches were conducted on January 27, 2014, and September 3, 2014. Speciﬁc key words/phrases and inclusion criteria used in the searches are identified in the original guideline document under each critical question.

Relevant articles from the bibliographies of included studies and more recent articles identiﬁed by committee members and reviewers were also included.

## Number of Source Documents



 **Study Selection**

1,765 references were identiﬁed in the updated literature search as potentially relevant to the critical questions (992 in the search on January 27, 2014, and 773 in the search on September 3, 2014). From these, 136 articles were selected from the January 27, 2014 search, and 59 articles from the September 3, 2014 search, resulting in a total of 195 new articles for full-text review.

For this policy, recommendations for question 1 were based on 1 Class I randomized controlled trial, 5 Class II articles, and 29 Class III studies. For question 2, recommendations were based on 1 Class II randomized controlled trial and 42 Class III studies.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Assessment of Classes of Evidence**

All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 committee members or methodologists; all Class I and Class II articles were graded by at least 2 methodologists. Each article was assigned a design class with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (e.g., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, such as randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassiﬁcation biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using a predetermined process related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a ﬁnal Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles identiﬁed with fatal ﬂaws or that were ultimately not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the speciﬁc critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-speciﬁc Classes of Evidence grading can be found in the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document.

Additionally, given recent changes to the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy development process, articles rated as Class I or II in the 2012 policy were also reviewed and graded by the committee methodologists using current grading forms (available at <http://acep.org/clinicalpolicies>). 

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



This policy is a product of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy development process and is based on the existing literature; when literature was not available, consensus of emergency physicians was used.

When possible, clinically oriented statistics (e.g., likelihood ratios, number needed to treat [NNT]) are presented to help the reader better understand how the results may be applied to the individual patient. For a definition of these statistical concepts, see Appendix C in the original guideline document.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:

**Strength of Recommendations**

**Level A recommendations**. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reﬂect a high degree of clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).

**Level B recommendations**. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (i.e., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).

**Level C recommendations**. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.

There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



This clinical policy was approved by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Board of Directors on June 24, 2015.

This guideline was endorsed by the Emergency Nurses Association on July 14, 2015.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

For this policy, recommendations for question 1 were based on 1 Class I randomized controlled trial, 5 Class II articles, and 29 Class III studies. For question 2, recommendations were based on 1 Class II randomized controlled trial and 42 Class III studies.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



See the "Potential Benefits" sections in the original guideline document for information on benefits of the specific interventions.

## Potential Harms



See the "Potential Harms" sections in the original guideline document for information on harms of the specific interventions.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the print journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of _Annals of Emergency Medicine_ and its editors. 
  * This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of patients with acute ischemic stroke but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. 
  * It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. 
  * This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline deﬁnes for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy.
