# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The levels of recommendation ( **1-3** ) and the data quality classifications ( **I-IV** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Epidemiology and Overview 


####  Risk Factors 


  1. Nurses should be aware that children with hereditary syndromes may be at increased risk for brain tumors. Nurses caring for children with these genetic syndromes should observe for signs and symptoms that may suggest a central nervous system (CNS) tumor ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses should have a basic understanding of genetic predisposition as it relates to pediatric brain tumors. This knowledge should be used to assess a child's risk for developing CNS tumors ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. Nurses should possess awareness of the resources available to optimize care coordination and use a multidisciplinary approach to manage symptoms and improve function and quality of life ( **Level 2** ). 
  4. Nurses should know how to identify risk factors of hereditary syndromes that present unique and complex issues. Nurses will use this knowledge to guide families in future decision making and improve the care of long-term survivors ( **Level 2** ). 
  5. Nurses will assist families during genetic counseling by identifying personal risk and screening options, early detection methods, and risk-reduction strategies ( **Level 2** ). 




####  Tumor Types 


  1. Nurses should apply their knowledge of tumor origins, functional anatomy, and physiology when completing a patient assessment ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses should correlate anatomical location of the brain tumor with clinical condition when monitoring for neurologic improvement or deterioration ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. Nurses should apply knowledge of tumor classification, site, tissue involved, and histology as they guide patients and families through the care continuum ( **Level 3** ). 
  4. Nurses should integrate basic comprehension of the molecular and histological diagnosis of pediatric brain tumors into patient and family education regarding treatment protocols specific to tumor subtype in preparation for treatment ( **Level 3** ). 




###  Diagnostic Techniques 


####  Computed Tomography (CT) 


  1. Nurses should advocate that CT scans only be performed when warranted to reduce exposure to radiation and decrease risk for radiation-induced cancer ( **Level 2** ). 
  2. Nurses should provide patient and family education regarding the signs and symptoms of acute renal failure if a patient receives a contrast CT in the outpatient setting ( **Level 2** ). 
  3. A licensed independent provider caring for the patient should be notified by the nurse if the patient demonstrates signs and symptoms of acute renal failure ( **Level 2** ). 




####  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 


  1. The patient should be assessed by the nurse prior to arrival into the MRI room to ensure that he or she is not wearing any metal and that there are no metal implants. This assessment will help to avoid potential harm or death ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses will ensure that a healthcare worker specially trained in MRI safety will perform an MRI screening assessment on the patient and any family member who will accompany the patient to the scanner prior to the exam and notify the ordering provider if the screening is positive for any metal devices ( **Level 2** ). 
  3. Nurses should educate patients regarding the large size of the MRI machine, the loud noise it makes, and the additional 10 to 15 minutes that some specialty MRIs necessitate. A child-life specialist should be consulted as needed to help provide age-appropriate education and distraction techniques ( **Level 2** ). 
  4. When the patient has a programmable ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, the nurse will ensure that the setting has been verified, both prior to and after the MRI scan, and ensure that the shunt is reprogrammed after the MRI, if necessary ( **Level 3** ). 
  5. Before the imaging study begins, nurses should assess the patient for claustrophobia and their ability to lie still. The nurse should notify the provider if sedation or general anesthesia will be needed and administer sedation as prescribed ( **Level 2** ). 
  6. Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels should be drawn prior to a contrasted MRI as ordered by the licensed independent practitioner, and abnormalities should be reported to the ordering provider ( **Level 2** ). 
  7. Nurses should ensure that a functional large-bore peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter is in place when a patient will be receiving IV contrast ( **Level 2** ). 
  8. Nurses should verify nothing-by-mouth (NPO) status as appropriate for the specific test being performed and notify and educate patients and families ( **Level 2** ). 
  9. Nurses will inform the patient that the person performing the scan may ask them to perform certain movements or lie still ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Biopsy 


Nurses should have a basic understanding of the surgical technique for biopsy so they can prepare/educate the patient and family on what to expect before and after surgery ( **Level 2** ). 


###  Acute Care 


####  Patient and Family Education and Support 


  1. Nurses must obtain an assessment to become familiar with a patient's baseline neurologic status, which allows the ability for comparisons to detect any acute changes ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. If the patient is an infant, the nurse should include the fontanel as a part of the neurologic assessment for signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. Nurses should assess the family's and patient's level of understanding of the current diagnosis ( **Level 3** ). 
  4. Nurses should communicate openly and honestly using terms and methods appropriate to each family situation, taking into consideration education level, cultural background, and coping skills ( **Level 3** ). 
  5. Nurses should allow patients and family members to ask questions and provide answers as appropriate to the nurse's knowledge and role ( **Level 3** ). 
  6. Nurses should provide patients and families with writing materials so they may write down questions to prepare for their conversation with providers ( **Level 3** ). 
  7. Nurse should communicate next steps; for example, surgery, biopsy, pathology, and factors determining further treatment ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Emergency Intervention 


  1. Nurses should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of increased ICP ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses should manage the external ventricular drain (EVD) to monitor ICP, maintain patency, and to drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as prescribed ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Medications Used During the Acute Phase 


  1. Nurses should use their knowledge of the potential side effects of steroid use in pediatric patients with brain tumors and provide ongoing assessment of possible symptoms, applying that knowledge to assess for complications associated with their use ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses should communicate any signs or symptoms that may indicate a need for steroid dose change with the healthcare team to assist in determining treatment duration and/or symptom management ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. Nurses should educate patients and/or family members regarding known side effects and their symptoms and assist them in symptom management ( **Level 3** ). 
  4. Nurses should teach patients and/or families that abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids must be avoided, and that a taper schedule must be followed as prescribed ( **Level 2** ). 




####  Seizures 


  1. Nurses should be aware of the potential risk and individual risk factors for seizures in pediatric patients with brain tumors and provide appropriate seizure care ( **Level 2** ). 
  2. Nurses should monitor for the side effects and drug interactions of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used in children with newly diagnosed brain tumors, particularly in patients receiving multiple classes of medications ( **Level 1** ). 
  3. Nurses should educate patients and families about compliance with AED therapy, drug interactions, and potential side effects ( **Level 1** ). 




###  Surgery 


####  Primary Goal 


  1. Because gross total resection of low-grade gliomas, if achieved with acceptable functional outcomes, offers the best chance for progression-free survival, nurses should emphasize preoperatively that technology (e.g., image guidance, functional brain mapping, intraoperative imaging, neurophysiological monitoring) has improved the safety of tumor resection, and gross total resection improves survival ( **Level 1** ). 
  2. When performing preoperative education with parents, nurses will use the knowledge that the most important prognosticator for outcome in children with most types of malignant brain tumors is the extent of the tumor removal. This education will provide important information when discussing preoperative preparation and surgical outcomes with the parents and patient ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. Nurses should know that brain stem gliomas can usually be identified noninvasively with the use of MRI and plan the patient's care accordingly ( **Level 3** ). 
  4. Nurses should be aware of the need for staged surgical resection because patients and families will need preparation and support if they are to undergo more than one surgical procedure ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Shunts 


  1. During parent/patient education, nurses will mention in their discussion that fewer than 25% of children with malignant tumors require postoperative shunting based on information obtained in the late 1990s ( **Level 1** ). 
  2. Nurses will teach parents/patients that during the past 2 decades, the VP shunt has been used more cautiously for obstructive hydrocephalus. Instead, more radical tumor resections and more frequent use of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) are performed to reduce shunting ( **Level 2** ). 
  3. Nurses should be aware of signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus when assessing a child with a newly diagnosed brain tumor and closely monitor these children for early signs of neurological deterioration ( **Level 3** ). 
  4. Nurses should know that children with programmable valves must have their settings rechecked after MRI because the MRI magnet may alter the settings. Nurses will ensure that the need for shunt valve setting verification is communicated to all team members, and especially to the person responsible for performing the shunt reprogramming ( **Level 2** ). 
  5. Nurses will explain to parents that an Ommaya reservoir may be used to aspirate any recurrence of the cystic portion of the craniopharyngioma ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Postoperative Complications 


  1. Nurses should reassure patients/parents that in regard to surgery for brain tumor resection, benefits generally outweigh risks. They should reinforce that surgery allows for diagnosis, symptom improvement, and reduction of tumor burden so other treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy are more effective ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses should carefully observe for signs of infection (fever, redness, discharge, swelling at incision site, stiff neck, photophobia) and hemorrhage (decreasing hemoglobin, increased heart rate, decreased blood pressure) and increased ICP (decrease in level of consciousness, bradycardia, hypertension) ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. Nurses should report CSF leaks to the patient's medical team immediately ( **Level 3** ). 




#####  Cerebellar Mutism Syndrome (CMS) 


Careful follow-up for patients with CMS includes neuropsychological evaluation and critical support for patients and their families, and nurses should collaborate with the multidisciplinary team to provide these services ( **Level 3** ). 


#####  Electrolyte Disturbance 


  1. Nurses should collaborate and plan with neurosurgery, endocrine, and intensive care providers to monitor electrolytes after surgery in patients with brain tumor who undergo craniotomy, particularly patients who have suprasellar (i.e., germinoma, craniopharyngioma), thalamic, or hypothalamic tumors ( **Level 2** ). 
  2. Exogenous vasopressin/antidiuretic hormone, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) may be ordered for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI), and fluid restriction may be required for patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Nurses will monitor intake and output, daily weights, and laboratory results such as urine and serum sodium and osmolality as ordered by the licensed healthcare provider ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. Nurses will administer DDAVP as ordered and monitor the outcomes of each treatment ( **Level 2** ). 




#####  Dysphagia Outcome 


Nurses should be aware that children who undergo posterior fossa tumor resection are at risk for aspiration and should be considered for evaluation by speech pathology to detect any swallowing impairment before attempting oral feedings. Nurses should collaborate with the provider to obtain a swallow evaluation as needed ( **Level 3** ). 


#####  Lower Cranial Nerve Dysfunction 


Nurses should know that children with intrinsic intramedullary tumors have lower cranial nerve dysfunction. With this knowledge, nurses should participate in discussions with parents about the possibility of postoperative tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement, but should also reassure them that most patients recover their lower cranial nerve function ( **Level 3** ). 


####  Rehabilitation 


  1. Nurses should support and encourage appropriate rehabilitation referral services to improve function after brain tumor resection ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses should collaborate with the provider to obtain a speech-language hearing screen/evaluation as needed ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Preparation for Surgery 


  1. Allowing parents to accompany their child into the operating room (OR) for induction of anesthesia in addition to premedicating the child with midazolam can decrease the parents' anxiety and increase their satisfaction ( **Level 1** ). 
  2. Nurses should advocate for parents to accompany their child into the OR and prepare the parent for what they may observe ( **Level 1** ). 




####  Preoperative Shaving 


  1. When performing preoperative teaching, the nurse should explain that shaving the head is not necessary for wound healing and is done by physician preference ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. If the child is anxious about loss of hair due to preoperative shaving, the nurse should encourage the child and family to talk with the neurosurgeon about their concerns before surgery ( **Level 3** ). 
  3. The OR nurse may consider saving a small portion of a child's shaved hair to give to the parents, particularly if the child is an infant because this may be his or her first haircut ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Pain 


  1. Nurses should carefully assess postoperative pain in patients who undergo craniotomy and consistently use age-appropriate pain scales ( **Level 3** ). 
  2. Nurses should recognize that older children or those who undergo lengthy procedures may need more medication to control their pain and administer analgesics accordingly ( **Level 3** ). 




####  Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prevention

####  Follow-up Care 


  1. Follow-up care and periodic screening based on assessment, tumor location, and type of treatment are a necessity, and nurses should educate patients and families and make referrals to long-term cancer centers or clinics ( **Level 2** ). 
  2. Nurses should educate patients and families of the critical importance of follow-up ( **Level 2** ). 
  3. Nurses should collaborate within organizations to place an effective reminder system in place targeting specific populations of cancer survivors because brain tumor survivors are less likely to continue long-term follow-up care ( **Level 2** ). 
  4. Nurses should educate childhood cancer survivors and their families about the increased risk for secondary tumors and other health conditions for more than 5 years after treatment ( **Level 2** ). 
  5. Nurses should be aware that because of high risk for mortality, subsequent cancers, and other medical conditions, survivors of pediatric brain tumors will require specialized care and screening in a cancer center or a clinic specifically intended for long-term follow-up of pediatric patients with brain tumors, and that it is critical to encourage and coordinate referrals as necessary ( **Level 2** ). 
  6. Nurses should use appropriate interventions during each phase of care, adapting and changing them to effectively address the varying needs of patients ( **Level 2** ).

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



A comprehensive review of literature published prior to July 2013 was performed using the PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and OVID databases. Key words (and combinations of them) included ICU management, acute seizures, resection, biopsy, pediatric, brain tumor, neuro-oncology, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, end of life, palliative care, event-free survival, craniospinal radiotherapy, central nervous system tumor, oncology, patient reported outcomes, cognitive training, childhood cancer, social, academic, neuropsychologic, off therapy, pediatric oncology nursing, attention problems, survivorship, late effects, nursing roles, and cancer. Preference was given to randomized clinical trials, especially those performed within the last 5 years; however, historically significant literature was referenced in the absence of more current and rigorous research.

Secondary references were discovered from primary references, but all efforts were made to retrieve secondary references and give appropriate credit to the original author and/or study.

Online references were used sparingly, and sources are included in the reference list.

Textbook references such as Adamson, Bagatell, Balis, and Blaney (2011); Blaney et al. (2011); and chemotherapy administration guidelines (Ettinger & Rale, 2011) from the American Pediatric Hematology Oncology Nursing Society and other publications appropriate to the topic were reviewed, used, and cited in the absence of evidence of clinical trials.

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The _Clinical Practice Guidelines_ and recommendations for practice are established based upon the evaluation of the available evidence. Resources and recommendations must describe the best practices that can enable registered nurses (RNs) to provide optimal care for people with brain tumors.

For this clinical practice guideline, a patient population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) question was posed: For a pediatric patient with a brain tumor, what constitutes best care? Then, an outline of the content was developed by the 7 subject matter experts/authors.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Levels of Recommendation**

**Level 1** : Recommendations are supported by Class I evidence

**Level 2** : Recommendations are supported by Class II evidence

**Level 3** : Recommendations are supported by Class III and IV evidence

## Cost Analysis



Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology uses a very large magnet and is the most cost-effective diagnostic study for children when a high suspicion for brain tumor exists.

## Method of Guideline Validation

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



The recommendations may assist nurses in making appropriate choices when caring for pediatric patients with brain tumor and for supporting their families.

## Potential Harms



  * Common corticosteroid side effects include gastrointestinal effects, immunosuppression, weight gain, insomnia, behavioral changes, skin fragility, and electrolyte/metabolic disturbances. See Table 5 in the original guideline document for more information. 
  * Potential acute effects of radiotherapy include skin erythema, hyperpigmentation, ulceration and desquamation, alopecia, hypothalamic dysfunction, pituitary dysfunction, headache, somnolence/fatigue, dry eyes, pericarditis, radiation pneumonitis, mucositis, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, anorexia, and malnutrition. See Table 6 in the original guideline document for more information. 
  * Hair loss is a common side effect of chemotherapy. See Table 7 in the original guideline document for more information on side effects of chemotherapeutic agents. 
  * In a prospective trial in 2012, focal cranial radiation therapy (CRT) provided no significant decrease in either cognitive or motor functioning 4 years after treatment. The study reports, however, that the children were developmentally impaired, indicating that surgery and/or the effects of the tumor have more influence on neurocognitive dysfunction than formerly identified. 
  * Many studies report that childhood cancer survivors have one or more long-term medical effects after treatment (e.g., headache; hearing impairment; hydrocephalus/shunt dependence; neurogenic bowel/bladder; neuropathy including numbness and tingling in the extremities, which has been reported when treatment includes platinum-based chemotherapy; reduced loss of vision/visual field deficits). 
  * Seizures can occur more than 5 years after treatment. An increased risk of seizures may occur with radiation therapy (RT) and in younger children. 
  * Valproic acid (Depakene, Depakote) may have antitumoral effects, but thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction may occur, increasing the chance of intratumoral bleeding. It is also highly teratogenic, making it a significantly undesirable choice for females who have started their menses. 
  * Phenytoin and/or fosphenytoin (Dilantin) is also commonly used, especially for acute, prolonged seizures; however, levels need to be monitored for efficacy if it continues to be used for maintenance dosing. 
  * Levetiracetam can cause behavior changes such as irritability, mood swings, and irrational behavior. 
  * Sensory/motor deficits can develop after surgery including focal extremity weakness, truncal/appendicular ataxia, sensory deficits, and cranial nerve deficits. 
  * Stroke is a risk factor after RT. 
  * Nephrologic effects can occur, particularly after administration of platinum-containing chemotherapy. 
  * The most common postoperative complications are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak leading to postoperative meningitis, wound infections, hematomas, and neurological deficits. 
  * Justifiable concerns about the toxicity of radiation in young children may contribute to the higher mortality seen in infants with brain tumors than in older children. 
  * Childhood brain tumor survivors are at increased risk for late endocrine effects, especially children treated with cranial RT and younger than 3 years of age. 
  * An increased risk for developing a secondary central nervous system (CNS) tumor resulting from cranial and spinal radiation is related to the dose of RT and younger age at diagnosis. 
  * A secondary cancer can occur 10 or more years after initial radiation. 
  * Cardiac complications can occur years after receiving RT. 
  * Risk factors for sleep disturbance include radiation, extensive surgery, and chemotherapy. 
  * Septicemia, nutritional compromise, significant pain, and long-term morbidity are recognized oral complications of cancer therapy. Negative effects include mucositis; viral, bacterial, and fungal infections; xerostomia; and dental abnormalities including root stunting, microdontia, hypodontia, and overretention of primary teeth. 
  * Social adjustment, social performance, and social skills are decreased in childhood brain tumor survivors after treatment. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications



Dexamethasone should be avoided as a premedication or prechemotherapy antiemetic in patients with brain tumors because of the ability of dexamethasone to decrease the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in decreased efficacy of the chemotherapy.
