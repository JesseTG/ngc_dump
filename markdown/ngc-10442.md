## Guideline Objective(s)



  * To provide an educational resource for physicians who treat injured workers in the Washington workers' compensation system under Title 51 Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and review criteria for the Department's utilization review team to help ensure diagnosis and treatment of cauda equina syndrome is of the highest quality 
  * To provide standards that ensure a uniformly high quality of care for injured workers in Washington State 
  * To summarize information from the available medical literature and expert clinical opinion to help physicians make an accurate diagnosis quickly and deliver the appropriate care as soon as possible 



## Target Population



The injured worker with cauda equina syndrome

## Interventions and Practices Considered



 **Diagnosis/Evaluation**

  1. Evaluation of subjective (sensory symptoms) and objective (neurological deficits) clinical findings 
  2. Diagnostic tests, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan or CT myelography, x-rays, ultrasound, or urodynamic tests 



**Treatment**

  1. Conservative treatment (not generally recommended) 
  2. Decompression surgery (e.g., micro discectomy, wide laminectomy with discectomy) 



## Major Outcomes Considered



  * Incidence of work-related cauda equina syndrome (CES) 
  * Appropriate authorization of CES surgeries by the utilization review team and claim adjudicators 
  * Incidence of CES by cause (disc herniation, trauma, etc.) 
  * Degree of recovery following treatment 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The literature search was conducted in February and March of 2014. PubMed was the main database searched for peer reviewed articles. The search terms used in PubMed were: _cauda equina syndrome, cauda equina syndrome and treatment, cauda equina syndrome and diagnosis, cauda equina syndrome and evidence-based medicine_. The search was filtered to select English language and humans, in the past five years. The studies reviewed were case articles, case reports, and case series studies (of class III/IV evidence). Cauda equina syndrome is not appropriate for randomized controlled studies.

Filters: 5 years, abstract available, English and humans

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

- Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p>The quality and strength of the evidence were assessed using the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) clinical guideline process manual rating scheme. More information about the Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) guideline process is included in a separate document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Refer to the <a href="https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/Home/Development" title="AAN Web site">AAN Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual</a>.</p></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Not stated

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The process for guideline development is contained in a separate document, titled Medical Treatment Guidelines in Washington Workers' Compensation, June 2010 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). A formal subcommittee was not convened for this review of the carpal tunnel syndrome guideline. The review was conducted by Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) staff, and discussed with the Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) members who worked on the previous guideline, then discussed and voted on in a meeting of the full IIMAC on April 25, 2014.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Not applicable

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



This guideline was carefully reviewed by Labor & Industries' epidemiology and health policy staff, and then by the Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC), which included the main author of the previous acute cauda equina syndrome (CES) guideline.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is not specifically stated for each recommendation.

This guideline was based on the weight of the best available clinical and scientific evidence from a systematic review of the literature and on a consensus of expert opinion.Â Due to the emergent nature of acute cauda equina syndrome (CES), controlled studies are not feasible and the literature is limited to case series, case studies and narrative reviews.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of work-related acute cauda equina syndrome (CES)

## Potential Harms



Not stated

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



This guideline is intended as an educational resource for physicians who treat injured workers in the Washington workers' compensation system under Title 51 Revised Code of Washington (RCW). The guideline serves as a review criteria for the Department's utilization review team to help ensure diagnosis and treatment of cauda equina syndrome is of the highest quality. The emphasis is on accurate diagnosis and treatment that is curative or rehabilitative.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



Most guidelines are implemented within the utilization review (UR) program. Labor and Industries (L&I) guidelines have priority over other proprietary guidelines and criteria that may exist. Where L&I guidelines are not available, proprietary ones may be used. Reviewers apply each guideline as a standard for the majority of requests in the Washington workers' compensation program. For the minority of workers who appear to fall outside of the guideline and whose complexity of clinical findings exceeds the specificity of the guideline, further review by a physician is conducted.

When a surgical procedure is requested for a patient who meets the guideline criteria, the reviewer will recommend approval to the claim manager. If the criteria are not met, the request will be referred to a physician consultant who will review the patient's file, offer to discuss the case with the requesting physician, and make a recommendation to the claim manager. The flexibility built into this decision-making process helps legitimize the work of the subcommittee in the eyes of practicing physicians in Washington.

Completed guidelines will be communicated to practicing physicians via L&I's website and through its [provider listserv](http://www.lni.wa.gov/Main/Listservs/Provider.asp "Washington State Department of L and I Web site"). Education and training will be provided to reviewers and staff to ensure their proper application within the UR program. Where possible, continuing medical education (CME) credits may be offered.
