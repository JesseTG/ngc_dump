# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Level of evidence grades (I-III) and strength of recommendations (A-C) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


**Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)** : Recommendations on atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment and management are subdivided into 4 sections given the significant breadth of the topic. This document is the final in the series of 4 publications and discusses the management and control of AD flares using topical modalities and the utility and timing of allergen testing and avoidance. Also discussed is the use of adjunctive therapies and approaches, such as environmental, dietary, and educational interventions, in addition to complementary therapies. 


###  Recommendation for Prevention of Flares of Atopic Dermatitis 


Continued use of either topical corticosteroids (1 to 2 times/week) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (2 to 3 times/week) after disease stabilization, to previously involved skin, is recommended to reduce subsequent flares or relapses.

###  Recommendations for Educational Interventions for Atopic Dermatitis 


  * Educational programs (i.e., training programs and "eczema schools") are recommended as an adjunct to the conventional therapy of AD. 
  * Video interventions can be recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy. 
  * Eczema workshops and nurse-led programs may be useful as an adjunct to conventional therapy. 




###  Recommendations for Testing for Coexisting Allergic Disease 


  * AD patients have an increased rate of environmental and food allergies, and physicians should assess for these conditions during history taking. If significant concerns for allergy are identified (i.e., hives, urticaria, etc.) assessment can be undertaken. Allergy testing independent of history is not recommended. 
  * Patch testing should be considered in patients with AD who have persistent/recalcitrant disease and/or a history or physical examination findings consistent with allergic contact dermatitis. 




###  Recommendations for Other Adjunctive and Complementary Interventions for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 


  * Food elimination diets based solely on the findings of food allergy test results are not recommended for the management of AD. 
  * If a patient has a true immunoglobulin E-mediated allergy, he or she should practice avoidance to prevent potential serious health sequelae. 
  * Children  <5 years of age with moderate to severe AD should be considered for food allergy evaluation for milk, egg, peanut, wheat, and soy if at least 1 of the following is met: (A) persistent AD in spite of optimized treatment or (B) having a reliable history of immediate reaction after ingestion of a specific food. 
  * The use of probiotics/prebiotics for the treatment of patients with established AD is not recommended because of inconsistent evidence. 
  * There is inconsistent to no evidence to recommend the use of fish oils, evening primrose oil, borage oil, multivitamin supplements, zinc, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamins B  12  and B  6  for the treatment of AD. 
  * There is limited evidence to support the routine use of house dust mite covers to treat patients with AD who are sensitized to dust mites. 
  * The use of specific laundering techniques, such as double rinsing, detergents, or other laundry products cannot be recommended for AD treatment because of the lack of clinical studies. 
  * There is limited evidence to support the use of specialized clothing fabrics in the treatment of AD. 
  * In the general AD population, sublingual immunotherapy and injection immunotherapy are not recommended for the treatment of AD because of the small number of studies and conflicting conclusions. 
  * Chinese herbal therapy and massage therapy have insufficient evidence for recommendation for AD treatment. 
  * The use of aromatherapy, naturopathy, hypnotherapy, acupressure, or autologous blood injections cannot be recommended for the treatment of AD at this time because of insufficient evidence.

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



An evidence-based model was used, and evidence was obtained using a search of the PubMed and the Global Resources for Eczema Trials databases from November 2003 through November 2012 for clinical questions addressed in the previous version of this guideline published in 2004, and from 1960 to 2012 for all newly identified clinical questions determined by the work group to be of importance to clinical care. Searches were prospectively limited to publications in the English language. Medical Subject Headings terms used in various combinations in the literature search included: atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema, surveillance, long-term management, short-term management, short-term care, long-term care, flare progression, relapse, patient follow-up, patient compliance, contact allergen, contact allergy screen, contact allergy test, desensitization, allergen antibody, antiallergen, antibody, dust mites, environmental, food allergy, irritant avoidance, detergent, clothing, diet, supplement, food introduction, oil, pyridoxine, vitamin, zinc, education, complementary, alternative, herb, supplement, homeopathy, massage, acupuncture, and Chinese medicine.

A total of 2062 abstracts were initially assessed for possible inclusion. After the removal of duplicate data, 287 were retained for final review based on relevancy and the highest level of available evidence for the outlined clinical questions.

The Academy's previously published guidelines on atopic dermatitis (AD) were evaluated, as were other current published guidelines on AD.

## Number of Source Documents



A total of 287 publications were retained for final review

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

- Weighting According to a Rating Scheme (Scheme Given)

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence

<div class="content_para"><p>Evidence was graded using a 3-point scale based on the quality of methodology and the overall focus of the study as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;" start="1">
    <li>Good-quality<em> patient-oriented evidence </em>(i.e., evidence measuring outcomes that matter to patients: morbidity, mortality, symptom improvement, cost reduction, and quality of life)</li>
    <li>Limited-quality patient-oriented evidence</li>
    <li>Other evidence, including consensus guidelines, opinion, case studies, or <em>disease-oriented evidence</em> (i.e., evidence measuring intermediate, physiologic, or surrogate end points that may or may not reflect improvements in patient outcomes) </li>
</ol></div>

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Evidence tables were generated for included studies and used by the work group in developing recommendations.

The available evidence was evaluated using a unified system called the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) developed by editors of the US family medicine and primary care journals (i.e., _American Family Physician_ , _Family Medicine_ , _Journal of Family Practice_ , and _BMJ USA_ ). Evidence was graded using a 3-point scale based on the quality of methodology (e.g., randomized control trial, case control, prospective/retrospective cohort, case series, etc.) and the overall focus of the study (i.e., diagnosis, treatment/prevention/screening, or prognosis) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



A work group of recognized atopic dermatitis (AD) experts was convened to determine the audience and scope of the guideline, and to identify important clinical questions in the management of flare progression and the use of adjunctive therapies and approaches.

Clinical questions used to structure the evidence review for the prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches:

  * What are the most effective approaches to preventing flares in patients with AD? 
  * What types of educational interventions are used in patients with atopic dermatitis to improve patient outcome, and are they effective? 
  * What is the utility of screening for allergens on the course of AD and what are the suggested testing methods? 
  * What is the effectiveness of dietary interventions, such as dietary restriction based on food allergy and sensitization testing, and the use of supplements, such as evening primrose oil, borage oil, fish oil, pyridoxine, vitamin E, multivitamins, and zinc for the treatment of AD? 
  * What environmental modifications, such as house dust mite reduction, choice of clothing, irritant avoidance, and use of detergents can be implemented to influence the course of AD? 
  * What is the effect of allergen-based interventions (e.g., desensitization injections, allergen-antibody complexes of house dust mites) on the course of AD? 
  * What is the effectiveness of complementary therapies, such as Chinese herbs and other supplements, homeopathy, and massage therapy for the treatment of AD? 



Clinical recommendations were developed based on the best available evidence. In those situations where documented evidence-based data were not available, the work group used expert opinion to generate their clinical recommendations.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Clinical recommendations were developed based on the best available evidence. These are ranked as follows:

  1. Recommendation based on consistent and good-quality patient-oriented evidence. 
  2. Recommendation based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence. 
  3. Recommendation based on consensus, opinion, case studies, or disease-oriented evidence. 



## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



This guideline has been developed in accordance with the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD)/AAD Association _Administrative Regulations for Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines_ (version approved May 2010), which includes the opportunity for review and comment by the entire AAD membership and final review and approval by the AAD Board of Directors.

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD)

## Potential Harms



  * One study recorded a higher rate of viral and respiratory tract infections and another found increased ear, nose, and throat symptoms in patients who used topical corticosteroids (TCS). Another long-term safety study of up to 44 weeks of intermittent treatment noted abnormal cosyntropin stimulation testing in 2 of 44 subjects. 
  * Side effects for proactive topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) use were mainly application site reactions, and in one study, skin infections and nasopharyngitis occurred, but these side effects were also seen with the vehicle. Given the current black box warning against continuous TCI use, it seems prudent to apply them intermittently to minimize any potential long-term risks. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful treatment in every situation. Furthermore, these guidelines should not be interpreted as setting a standard of care or be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care nor exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific therapy must be made by the physician and the patient in light of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient, and the known variability and biologic behavior of the disease. This guideline reflects the best available data at the time the guideline was prepared. The results of future studies may require revisions to the recommendations in this guideline to reflect new data. 
  * The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) or National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
  * In review of the currently available highest level of evidence, the expert work group acknowledges that while multiple studies have been performed on prevention of flares and the use of adjunctive therapies and approaches, much has yet to be learned.
