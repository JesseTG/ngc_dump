## Major Recommendations



The evidence grades ( **A-D, X** ) and evidence-based statements ( **Strong Recommendation** , **Recommendation** , and **Option** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Statement 1. Avoidance of Antibiotic Therapy 


######  Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antibiotic therapy for patients with a neck mass unless there are signs and symptoms of bacterial infection. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. 


**Action Statement Profile**


  * Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid routine treatment with antibiotics, which may be inappropriate or ineffective treatment for a neck mass, thus leading to delayed diagnosis of malignancy or other serious illness. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective treatment, affordable quality care) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium 
  * Benefits: Avoid delay in diagnosis of malignancy, promote judicious antibiotic therapy, limit bacterial resistance, reduce antibiotic adverse effects, reduced cost 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Under treatment of a missed bacterial infection 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: Perception by the guideline development group (GDG) that antibiotics are common for noninfectious neck masses, delaying diagnosis and/or referral. Further perception that physical examination is the primary determinant of an infectious cause of a neck mass, and history is a secondary determinant. 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 2a. Stand-Alone Suspicious History 


Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy when the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. 


**Action Statement Profile**


  * Quality improvement opportunity: To use simple questions to identify patients at increased risk for malignancy based on specific historical features. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective prevention/treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium 
  * Benefits: Improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis, identify patients with an earlier stage of disease, prioritize testing for high-risk patients, potentially reduce risk of distant metastases through earlier cancer identification, provide psychological benefit through timely evaluation, facilitate further care 
  * Risks, harms, costs: False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: The risk of missing or delaying diagnosis of a malignancy in a patient who is at increased risk is more important than false-positive clinical diagnosis in a patient with nonmalignant disease. Assumption by the GDG that early identification of patients at increased risk with focused questions can improve outcomes, despite any direct clinical evidence to substantiate this assumption. 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 2b. Stand-Alone Suspicious Physical Examination 


Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy based on ≥1 of these physical examination characteristics: fixation to adjacent tissues, firm consistency, size  >1.5 cm, and/or ulceration of overlying skin. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: To identify patients at increased risk for malignancy because of specific features on physical examination. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective prevention/treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium 
  * Benefits: Improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis, identify patients with earlier stage of disease, prioritize testing for patients at increased risk, potentially reduce risk of distant metastases through earlier cancer identification, psychological benefit of timely evaluation, facilitate further care 
  * Risks, harms, costs: False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: The risk of missed or delayed diagnosis of malignancy is more important than the risk of a false-positive clinical diagnosis. Despite any direct clinical evidence, the GDG assumed that early identification of patients at increased risk of malignancy may improve outcomes. 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: GDG debated whether firm consistency of the mass is a predictor of malignancy (majority opinion: 14 of 18 felt that firmness is predictive of malignancy); GDG also debated whether absolute size of the mass, regardless of neck location, is a predictor of malignancy. 




###  Statement 2c. Additional Suspicious Signs and Symptoms 


Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for all adults with a neck mass to identify those patients with an increased risk for malignancy. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: This statement moves beyond the previously noted stand-alone suspicious findings (lack of infectious etiology, ≥2-week duration of the mass, reduced mobility, firm texture, size >1.5 cm, ulceration) by using the initial history and examination to identify patients who have signs and symptoms that place them at increased risk of malignancy. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, promoting effective prevention/treatments) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on case series 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium 
  * Benefits: Improve outcomes through earlier diagnosis, identify patients with earlier stage of disease, prioritize testing for increased-risk patients, potentially reduce risk of distant metastases through earlier cancer identification, psychological benefit of timely evaluation, facilitate further care 
  * Risks, harms, costs: False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: The risk of missing or delaying diagnosis of malignancy in an increased-risk patient is more important than potentially misclassifying patients with nonmalignant disease. Assumption by the GDG that early identification of at-risk status with the initial history and physical examination can improve outcomes. Assumption by the GDG that the listed signs and symptoms can predict risk of cancer above and beyond lack of infectious etiology, ≥2 weeks' duration of mass, reduced mobility, firm texture, size >1.5 cm, ulceration. 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 3. Follow-up of the Patient Not at Increased Risk 


For patients with a neck mass who are not at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should advise patients of criteria that would trigger the need for additional evaluation. Clinicians or their designees should also document a plan for follow-up to assess resolution or final diagnosis. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: Promote follow-up and engage patients in their care for better outcomes. (National Quality Strategy domains: engaging patients, effective prevention/treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium 
  * Benefits: Avoid false-negative diagnosis based on initial assessment, promote follow-up to ensure resolution of benign lesions and detect malignant masses, promote more timely diagnosis if the mass fails to resolve as expected, educate and empower patients, and promote shared decision making. 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Administrative burden for the clinician, health care cost of follow-up assessments 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: Perception by the GDG that patients with neck masses receive inconsistent follow-up, despite its importance 
  * Intentional vagueness: The timing and method of follow-up are not specified 
  * Role of patient preferences: Moderate regarding the method of follow-up 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 4. Patient Education 


For patients with a neck mass who are deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should explain to the patient the significance of being at increased risk and explain any recommended diagnostic tests. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with preponderance of benefits over harms. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, effective treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies of the utility of diagnostic tests and imaging studies to assist with diagnosis of neck mass

  * Benefits: Improve understanding of the risk of malignancy in a neck mass, as well as understanding of the need for targeted examination and tests/imaging, engage patients, establish expectations 
  * Risks, harms, costs: None 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: None 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 5. Targeted Physical Examination 


Clinicians should perform, or refer the patient to a clinician who can perform, a targeted physical examination (including visualizing the mucosa of the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx), for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. 


#####  Recommendation based on grade C aggregate evidence (observational studies) with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: To encourage the use of a complete examination of the neck and the mucosal surfaces of the aerodigestive tract. (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, effective treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C observational studies 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefits: Identification of a primary source of neck mass or malignancy, focus and prioritize subsequent diagnostic tests, ensure that the patient has a full examination of mucosal surfaces by someone with the necessary diagnostic skills and/or equipment 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Cost of visit, cost and risks of diagnostic tests, detection of incidental lesions, false-positive diagnosis, discomfort (e.g., laryngoscopy) 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: Consensus by the GDG that imaging is not a substitute for the additional information obtained by an examination that includes complete examination of the mucosal surfaces 
  * Intentional vagueness: The method (mirror or endoscope) of examination is at the discretion of the clinician, as is the decision to refer the patient to another clinician if one is unable to visualize the pharynx, base of tongue, and larynx. 
  * Role of patient preferences: Small to none; patient may decline examination 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 6: Imaging 


Clinicians should order a neck computed tomography (CT) (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) with contrast for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. 


#####  Strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials. 


**Action Statement Profile**


  * Quality improvement opportunity: To promote timely and effective imaging assessment of a neck mass in patients deemed at risk for malignancy 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, randomized controlled trials, consistent evidence from observational studies 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefits: Ensure that when imaging is ordered, the right test is selected and contrast is given, distinguish malignant from benign masses, plan for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or biopsy, define extent of disease to facilitate staging, detect occult disease, guide treatment decisions, further testing and referral

  * Value judgments: Perception by the GDG that some patients undergo inappropriate open biopsy prior to attempted FNA. The GDG also noted that some patients experience unwarranted delay prior to tissue biopsy 
  * Intentional vagueness: There are a variety of techniques, operators, and settings in which neck mass FNA may be performed; these choices are left to the discretion of the clinician and patient. 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Strong recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 8. Cystic Masses 


For patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians should continue evaluation of patients with a cystic neck mass, as determined by FNA or imaging studies, until a diagnosis is obtained and should not assume that the mass is benign. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid misdiagnosis of malignant lesions with potentially decreased survival (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, effective treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C

  * Value judgments: Concern by the GDG that some patients receive false reassurance that a cystic mass is not of concern despite studies showing a high rate of malignancy and false-negative biopsies in such masses 
  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 9. Ancillary Tests 


Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is at increased risk for malignancy and/or does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging. 


#####  Recommendation based on nonconsecutive studies, observational studies, case series, and panel consensus with preponderance of benefit over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: To identify laboratory or other test that can aid in neck mass diagnosis (National Quality Strategy domains: promoting effective prevention/treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, nonconsecutive studies, case-control studies, observational studies, case series 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium 
  * Benefits: Diagnose neck mass and avoid invasive procedures/anesthesia 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Direct costs of ancillary tests, false-positive tests, incidental findings, risk of failure to diagnose concurrent malignancy based on these test results 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: None 
  * Intentional vagueness: The specific tests and timing are at the discretion of the clinician 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 10. Examination Under Anesthesia of the Upper Aerodigestive Tract Before Open Biopsy 


Clinicians should recommend examination of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia, before open biopsy, for patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy and without a diagnosis or primary site identified with FNA, imaging, and/or ancillary tests. 


#####  Recommendation based observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Quality improvement opportunity: To improve understanding that a neck mass may be a metastatic lesion from a primary aerodigestive site and that identification of these lesions improves treatment outcomes (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, effective treatment) 
  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefits: Potentially identify a primary site of cancer or rule out malignancy, obtain tissue for diagnosis 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Direct costs of procedures, adverse effects of anesthesia, dental injury, cranial nerve injury, rare complications of endoscopy (bleeding, infection, perforation, airway obstruction) 
  * Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: Perception that some clinicians may be performing open biopsy of the neck before or without endoscopy during the same trip to the operating room and that endoscopy should preferably be performed prior to open biopsy 
  * Intentional vagueness: The decision to perform open biopsy is at the discretion of the clinician (after FNA has been performed and is not diagnostic) but is usually performed after the endoscopy if the endoscopy does not reveal a primary site and if a high suspicion for malignancy remains 
  * Role of patient preferences: Small. May decline intervention. 
  * Exceptions: Patients who are at increased risk of procedure (anesthesia) 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: Within the GDG, there were differences of opinion about whether the surgeon should be prepared to do a neck dissection at the same time as an open biopsy and frozen section

</table>## Clinical Algorithm(s)



An algorithm titled "Algorithm depicting the relationship among the key action statements (KASs)" is provided in the original guideline document.

# Scope

## Disease/Condition(s)



Neck mass

**Note** : A neck mass is defined as an abnormal lesion (congenital or acquired) that is visible, palpable, or seen on an imaging study. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) further qualified neck masses as any mass below the mandible, above the clavicle, and deep to the skin, although it may involve the overlying skin secondarily.

## Guideline Category

- Diagnosis
- Evaluation

## Clinical Specialty

- Family Practice
- Oncology
- Otolaryngology

## Intended Users

- Dentists
- Physicians

## Guideline Objective(s)



  * To promote the efficient, effective, and accurate diagnostic workup of neck masses to ensure that adults with potentially malignant disease receive prompt diagnosis and intervention to optimize outcomes 
  * To craft a set of actionable statements relevant to diagnostic decisions made by a clinician in the workup of an adult patient with a neck mass 



## Target Population



Patients ≥18 years old with a neck mass

## Interventions and Practices Considered



  1. Avoidance of antibiotic therapy 
  2. Stand-alone suspicious history 
  3. Stand-alone suspicious physical examination 
  4. Investigation of additional suspicious signs and symptoms for those at increased risk 
  5. Follow-up of the patient not at increased risk 
  6. Patient education, counseling, and shared decision making including explanation of increased risk, risk factors and recommended diagnostic tests 
  7. Targeted physical examination (including visualizing the mucosa of the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx) 
  8. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck, with contrast 
  9. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) 
  10. Continued evaluation until diagnosis is obtained for patients with cystic mass 
  11. Ancillary tests 
  12. Examination of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia 



**Note** : The following was considered but not recommended: routinely prescribing antibiotic therapy (unless there is evidence of a bacterial infection).

## Major Outcomes Considered



  * Diagnostic accuracy of tests 
  * Earlier diagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
  * Identification of patients with an earlier stage of disease 
  * Reduction of risk of distant metastases 
  * Psychological benefit 
  * Quality of life 
  * Morbidity 
  * Mortality 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search**

The recommendations in this clinical practice guideline are based on systematic reviews identified by a professional information specialist using an explicit search strategy. Additional background evidence included randomized controlled trials and observational studies, as needed, to supplement the systematic reviews or to fill gaps when a review was not available. An information specialist conducted 2 systematic literature searches from December 2015 through February 2016 using a validated filter strategy to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and comparative studies. For a complete list of search terms, refer to the original guideline document. 

The English-language searches were performed in multiple databases, including PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, National Guideline Clearinghouse, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) UK, and Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infobase (Canada). In certain instances, targeted searches for lower-level evidence were performed to address gaps from the systematic searches identified in writing the guideline from April 2016 through November 2016. January 1980 was the beginning date for all of the searches.

## Number of Source Documents



  1. The initial search for clinical practice guidelines identified 11 guidelines. After removal of duplicates and irrelevant references, the total was 6 guidelines. Quality criteria for including guidelines were (a) an explicit scope and purpose, (b) multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement, (c) systematic literature review, (d) explicit system for ranking evidence, and (e) explicit system for linking evidence to recommendations.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined. Evidence-based statements reflect both the _quality of evidence_ and the _balance of benefit and harm_ that is anticipated when the statement is followed. The definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



This guideline was developed with an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm as outlined in the third edition of the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guideline development manual. The guideline development group (GDG) consisted of 21 panel members representing experts in advanced practice nursing, clinical pathology, consumer advocacy, emergency medicine, general practice medicine, general surgery, head and neck surgery and oncology, otolaryngology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, physician assistants, and radiology.

In a series of conference calls, the GDG defined the scope and objectives of the proposed guideline. During the 12 months devoted to guideline development ending in August 2016, the GDG met twice, with in-person meetings following the format previously described, with use of decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) to facilitate the creation of actionable recommendations and evidence profiles. Internal electronic review and feedback on each guideline draft were used to ensure accuracy of content and consistency with standardized criteria for reporting clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). 

The AAO-HNSF staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. Guideline panel members received summary appraisals in September 2016 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.

A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms (or, in the case of a negative recommendation, that the harms exceed the benefits), but the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C).a In some clearly identified circumstances, recommendations may be made based on lesser evidence when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms.

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) staff used the Guideline Implementability Appraisal and Extractor to appraise adherence of the draft guideline to methodological standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. Guideline panel members received summary appraisals in September 2016 and modified an advanced draft of the guideline.

The final guideline draft underwent extensive external peer review, including a period for open public comment. All comments received were compiled and reviewed by the panel's chair, and a modified version of the guideline was distributed and approved by the guideline development group (GDG). A scheduled review process will occur at 5 years from publication or sooner if new compelling evidence warrants earlier consideration.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * Prompt diagnosis and intervention to optimize patient outcomes 
  * Reducing delays in diagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
  * Appropriate testing, including imaging, pathologic evaluation, and empiric medical therapies 
  * Reducing inappropriate testing 
  * Appropriate physical examination when cancer is suspected 



For benefits of specific interventions considered in the guideline, see the "Major Recommendations" field.

## Potential Harms



  * Under treatment of a missed bacterial infection 
  * False-positive clinical diagnosis resulting in subsequent tests and anxiety in patients with nonmalignant disease 
  * Discomfort (e.g., laryngoscopy) 
  * Adverse effects of imaging (radiation, contrast adverse reactions, anxiety, claustrophobia) 
  * Adverse effects of anesthesia 
  * Dental injury 
  * Cranial nerve injury 
  * Rare complications of endoscopy (bleeding, infection, perforation, airway obstruction) 



For harms associated with specific interventions considered in the guideline, see the "Major Recommendations" field.

# Contraindications

## Contraindications



  * Regardless of whether computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed, intravenous contrast should always be used, unless there is a contraindication, such as contrast allergy, renal insufficiency, or prior diagnosis that excludes the use of contrast. 
  * Vascular lesions and carotid body tumors are sometimes listed as contraindications to neck aspiration, but reports exist describing uncomplicated aspiration of such lesions; however, imaging is recommended prior to fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for any suspected vascular lesion (e.g., pulsatile or thrill on palpation; bruit on auscultation). Use of anticoagulation therapy does not result in increased risk of bleeding after neck fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and therefore is also not considered an absolute contraindication to FNA. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating neck masses. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible clinician, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care, or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. 
  * Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent practice variation is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. 
  * Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline development group (GDG) sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



**Implementation Considerations**

The clinical practice guideline is published as a supplement to _Otolaryngology –Head and Neck Surgery_, which will facilitate reference and distribution. A full-text version of the guideline will be accessible, free of charge, at <http://www.entnet.org>. The guideline will be presented to the Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). members as a miniseminar at the 2017 AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting & OTO Experience. Existing brochures and publication by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline's recommendations. As a supplement to clinicians, an algorithm of the guideline's action statements has been provided (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document). The algorithm allows for a more rapid understanding of the guideline's logic and the sequence of the action statements. The guideline development group (GDG) hopes that the algorithm can be adopted as a quick reference guide to support the implementation of the guideline's recommendations.

## Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest



 **Financial Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest**

Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established "stake" in an issue.
