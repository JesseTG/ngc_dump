# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



#####  Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC): The following guidance was current as of April 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the original guideline document or the most current version. 


The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Key Points 


####  Epidemiology 


#####  Common 


Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in school-age children â€“ a U.S. community prevalence of 6-8% that is more common in boys **[ _C_ ] ** . In at least 30% of diagnosed children ADHD continues into adulthood, with 3-4% of adults meeting criteria for ADHD **[ _C_ ] ** . 


#####  Primary Care Provider 


Most children with ADHD receive care through primary care physicians. 


####  Diagnosis 


#####  Types 


#####  Diagnosis is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV-TR) criteria (see Table 1 in the original guideline document) [D]. The three main types are primary hyperactive, primary inattentive, and combined. 


#####  Multiple Sources 


No specific test can make the diagnosis. Input from both parents and teachers or other source is required. Some psychological rating tools are useful but are not diagnostic (e.g., Vanderbilt, Conners; see Figure 1, Tables 1  & 2, and Appendix A1 in the original guideline document). If a learning problem is suspected, consider neuropsychiatric testing for intelligence testing (IQ) and learning disorders. 


#####  Confused and Associated Conditions 


Diagnosis is complicated by overlapping symptoms or co-occurrence of other disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, fetal alcohol syndrome, major depressive disorders, learning disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, reactive attachment disorder; see Appendices B1 & B2 in the original guideline document). 


**Treatment** (See Table 4 in the original guideline document) 


#####  Drug Treatment 


  * Stimulants are the first line treatment and have proven benefit to most people. If one class of stimulant fails or has unacceptable side effects then another should be tried (Tables 5-7 in the original guideline document) **[ _IA_ ] ** . 
  * Atomoxetine is a secondary choice **[ _IA_ ] ** . (One reported side effect is suicidal thinking.) 
  * Other medications may be used alone or in combination depending upon the ADHD type, response to therapy or comorbidity profile: e.g., Alpha-II agonists (clonidine, guanfacine) with hyperactivity or impulsivity; bupropion (over age 8) with co-morbid depression; risperidone (atypical antipsychotic) for aggression (see Table 7 in the original guideline document) **[ _IIA_ ] ** . 
  * Comorbid conditions may require additional treatment (e.g., for depression) and consideration of referral to a mental health specialist. 




#####  Non-Pharmacologic Interventions 


  * Age-appropriate behavioral interventions at home: education and support **[ _IB_ ] ** ; parent interventions including routines, clear limits and positive reinforcement for target behaviors (for children); consider family therapy; cognitive behavioral techniques for adults **[ _IIB_ ] ** (see Table 8 and Appendix A2 in the original guideline document). 
  * School interventions: children with ADHD may qualify for a 504 education plan or special education services with individualized education plan (IEP) **[ _ID_ ] ** (see Appendices A3  & A4 in the original guideline document). 




####  Special Populations or Circumstances 


Special considerations apply to: 3-5 year olds, adolescents and adults, head-injured, intellectually disabled/autistic, fetal alcohol syndrome, and substance-abusing patients (see Appendix B3 in the original guideline document). 


####  Controversial Areas 


#####  Common Myths 


Several common beliefs related to ADHD are untrue, e.g., that it is not a real disorder, it is an over-diagnosed disorder, children with ADHD are over-medicated. 


#####  Diets 


Although a few studies suggest dietary modification may have promise, there is no proof of efficacy (e.g., individually tailored hypoallergenic diets, essential fatty acids, flax seed) **[ _IIB_ ] ** , studies have shown the Feingold diet and modifying sugar consumption have no effect **[ _IIIB_ ] ** . 


#####  Complementary Alternative Medicine 


Use is controversial, but common (see Appendix B4 in the original guideline document). 


###  Definitions: 


####  Levels of Evidence Supporting a Diagnostic Method or an Intervention 


  1. Randomized controlled trials 
  2. Controlled trials, no randomization 
  3. Observational trials 
  4. Opinion of expert panel 




####  Strength of Recommendation 


  1. Generally should be performed 
  2. May be reasonable to perform 
  3. Generally should not be performed

An algorithm is provided in the original guideline document for the diagnosis and treatment of the child age 4-18 years with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases
- Searches of Unpublished Data

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The literature search for this update began with results of the literature search performed in 2002 to develop the initial guideline released in 2005. The literature search for this update used keywords that were very similar to those used in the previous search. However, instead of beginning the search with literature in 2002, the guideline team accepted the search strategy and results for the search performed through April 2006 for the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

The search for this update was conducted prospectively using the major keywords of: attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, humans age 3-30, clinical guidelines, controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, English language, and published 1/1/07-1/1/10 on Medline. Additional key words for specific searches included: symptoms (academic underachievement, behavior problems, classroom behavior, classroom interventions, degree of functional impairment, evidence of school work, frequent disciplinary events, hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention, learning patterns, poor concentration, poor task completion, social adjustment), commonly associated/coexisting conditions (learning/language disorder, child abuse, medication side effects, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, depression), commonly confused conditions/differential diagnosis (learning disorder, intellectual disability, mood/anxiety disorder, abuse, developmental delay, static encephalopathy, pervasive development disorder, autism spectrum, absence seizures, sleep disorder, substance abuse) evaluation and testing (vision exam, hearing exam, growth chart, developmental review, neurological exam, chronic physical or mental disorders), rating scales for ADHD, qualitative electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), other EEG, cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral interventions (set limits, establish routines, provide positive reinforcement), parental intervention (parenting class, family therapy), alpha-II agonists (clonidine, tenex), antidepressants â€“ wellbutrin, effexor, tricyclics (imipramine, nortriptyline, desipramine), stimulants (adderall, concerta, daytrana, dexedrine, dextroamphetamine, focalin, metadate, methylphenidate, ritalin, vyvanse), modafanil, strattera, transitional and longitudinal care for adults (since 10/1/02), and nutritional supplements and diet (since 10/1/02).

The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.
