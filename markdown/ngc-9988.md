Abbreviations: S, "The Practice Committee suggests"; R, "The Practice Committee recommends"; BE, Barrett's esophagus; EG, eosinophilic gastroenteritis; EMAG, environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis; EoE, eosinophilic esophagitis; FS, flexible sigmoidoscopy; GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease; HGD, high-grade dysplasia; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IHC, immunohistochemistry; LGD, low-grade dysplasia; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 


Recommendations in this table are as specific as published literature allows. Consensus recommendations often do not exist. Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies were not available to guide tissue sampling suggestions. As a general principle of tissue acquisition, the Practice Committee suggests that specimen collection devices used to sample malignant tissue not be subsequently used on normal tissue to minimize the theoretical possibility of malignant contamination. For all conditions, in addition to the protocol listed, targeted biopsy samples should also be taken from any mucosal irregularities and sent in their own container for pathologic examination. 


*Specimens taken from a given geographic location should be submitted to pathology in their own container. 


†Recommendation is for a sporadic single fundic gland polyp that is not associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. Although sporadic fundic gland polyps have low to no malignant potential, expert opinion has been to remove fundic gland polyps larger than 1 cm. Withdrawal of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) may be considered in patients with fundic gland polyps larger than 1cm. 


#####  ‡If H pylori positive, treatment has been associated with regression of hyperplastic polyps. 


§Consideration should be given to sampling every 5 cm in the distal colon. 


ǁAlthough no hemorrhagic complications with biopsy were noted in the prospective literature, they have been reported in a retrospective study. Clinical judgment should be used to reduce number of biopsies if there is thought to be a significant bleeding risk. 


¶Alternatively, pending clinical scenario, FS/EGD may be performed consecutively during a single endoscopic session.

####  Recommendation Strength 


The strength of individual recommendations is based on both the aggregate evidence quality and an assessment of the anticipated benefits and harms. Weaker recommendations are indicated by phrases such as "the Practice Committee suggests," whereas stronger recommendations are typically stated as "the Practice Committee recommends." 
## Clinical Algorithm(s)



None provided

# Scope

## Disease/Condition(s)



Diseases of the digestive system requiring gastrointestinal endoscopy and mucosal tissue acquisition:

  * Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
  * Barrett's esophagus (BE) 
  * Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) 
  * Infectious esophagitis (viral, candidal) 
  * _Helicobacter pylori_ gastritis 
  * Environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (EMAG) 
  * Autoimmune atrophic metaplastic gastritis (AMAG) 
  * Gastric epithelial polyps 
  * Peptic ulcer disease 
  * Celiac disease 
  * Microscopic colitis 
  * Inflammatory bowel disease 
  * Acute graft-versus-host disease 



## Guideline Category

- Diagnosis
- Evaluation
- Management

## Clinical Specialty

- Gastroenterology
- Internal Medicine
- Oncology
- Pathology

## Intended Users

- Advanced Practice Nurses
- Physician Assistants
- Physicians

## Guideline Objective(s)



To provide guidelines for the use of gastrointestinal endoscopy in mucosal tissue sampling

## Target Population



Patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy and tissue acquisition for diagnosis or management of diseases of the digestive system

## Interventions and Practices Considered



Gastrointestinal mucosal tissue sampling, including:

  * Biopsy techniques 
  * Standard protocols 
  * Specimen handling 



## Major Outcomes Considered



Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and diagnostic yield of mucosal acquisition techniques

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



In preparing this guideline, a search of the medical literature within the date range of January 1993 to January 2013 was performed by using PubMed. Additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When few or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results of large series and reports from recognized experts.

## Number of Source Documents



Not stated

## Methods Used to Assess the Quality and Strength of the Evidence

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Not stated

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



Guidelines for appropriate use of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus at the time that the guidelines are drafted.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



The strength of individual recommendations is based on both the aggregate evidence quality and an assessment of the anticipated benefits and harms. Weaker recommendations are indicated by phrases such as "the Practice Committee suggests," whereas stronger recommendations are typically stated as "the Practice Committee recommends."

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



This document is a product of the Standards of Practice Committee. This document was reviewed and approved by the Governing Board of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Gastrointestinal endoscopy and tissue acquisition are fundamental to the diagnosis and management of diseases of the digestive system. The proper collection of tissue specimens is required for accurate pathologic diagnosis.

## Potential Harms



Not stated

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Guidelines for appropriate use of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus at the time that the guidelines are drafted. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of this guideline. 
  * This guideline is intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. This guideline is not a rule and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment. Clinical decisions in any particular case involve a complex analysis of the patient's condition and available courses of action. Therefore, clinical considerations may lead an endoscopist to take a course of action that varies from these guidelines.
