# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The strength of recommendation ( **strong** or **weak/conditional** ) and levels of evidence ( **high** , **moderate** , **low** or **very low** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1 


In patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal injuries (P), should proximal diversion (I) be performed versus primary repair (if feasible) without proximal diversion (C) to decrease the incidence of infectious complications (O) (see Table 2 in the original guideline document)? 


####  Recommendation 


Despite the **overall quality of evidence being very low** , the panel considered that most patients would place a high value on avoidance of mortality and infectious complications. All of these factors resulted in the formulation of a **conditional recommendation** by the committee. The committee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects. Thus, in patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal rectal injuries, the committee **conditionally recommends** proximal diversion (vs. nondiversion). 


###  PICO Question 2 


In patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal rectal injuries (P), should presacral drainage (I) versus no presacral drainage (C) be performed to decrease incidence of infectious complications (O) (see Table 3 in the original guideline document)? 


####  Recommendation 


In patients with nondestructive extraperitoneal rectal injuries, the committee **conditionally recommends against** the routine use of presacral drains. 


###  PICO Question 3 


In patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal rectal injuries (P), should distal rectal washout be performed (I) versus no distal rectal washout (C) to decrease the incidence of infectious complications (O) (see Table 4 in the original guideline document)? 


####  Recommendation 


In patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal rectal injuries, the committee **conditionally recommends not performing** distal rectal washout (vs. performance of distal rectal washout).

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Identification of References**

With the assistance of a professional medical librarian, a search of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database was conducted using PubMed and IndexCat, as well as proprietary indices hosted by Elsevier (Scopus) and EBSCO (CINAHL) with citations published between January 1900 and July 2014. The committee used the "related articles" function to broaden the search and scan all citations for relevance. In addition to the electronic search, they manually searched the bibliographies of recent reviews and articles. Articles were limited to those in the English language involving human subjects. A systematic review of the available databases using PubMed, IndexCat, Scopus, and CINAHL was performed with the following search terms: _rectum_ , _rectal_ , _anorectal_ , _trauma_ , _wound_ , _injury_ , _penetrating_ , _firearm_ , _gunshot_ , _stab_ , _impale_ , and _human_. Letters to the editor, single-case reports, book chapters, and review articles were excluded. Articles that focused specifically on injuries related to combat were excluded. In addition, pediatric literature was included in the search; however, none of the data addressed the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions. Of the 306 articles identified, 250 were eliminated for not relating to the PICO questions or not meeting inclusion criteria. The remaining 56 articles were each reviewed by two committee members to determine eligibility in this review. This resulted in 18 articles meeting inclusion criteria and addressing the PICO questions that had been formulated to create these guidelines (see Figure 1 in the original guideline document for a study selection flow diagram).

## Number of Source Documents



  * **Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) Question 1** : Fourteen articles were identified which addressed PICO Question 1. 
  * **PICO Question 2** : Seventeen articles were reviewed by the committee from which data were extracted to address PICO Question 2. 
  * **PICO Question 3** : Thirteen articles were available to address PICO Question 3.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



**Data Extraction and Methodology**

Following identification of the potentially pertinent 56 articles, each article was assigned to two committee members for extraction of data for each Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) in question. Because of the small numbers reported as well as heterogeneity and variability in reporting of data among the articles, meta-analysis was not practical for this guideline. Of the articles that were identified, only two were prospective, one observational and one randomized.

**PICO Question 1**

Data reported for mortality and infectious complications were pooled to determine overall rates. Intrinsic limitations of the data existed because of heterogeneity, nonstandardized study designs, and incomplete reporting of complications. In addition, several studies did not delineate between intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal injuries. 

**PICO Question 2**

Similarly to PICO Question 1, data reported for the outcomes of mortality and infectious complications were pooled to determine overall rates. The same limitations seen with PICO Question 1 existed. 

**PICO Question 3**

The data obtained for the outcomes of mortality and infectious complications were pooled to determine overall rates. This data set was limited similarly to the data for PICO Questions 1 and 2.

**Grading the Evidence**

**PICO Question 1**

The overwhelming majority of data related to this PICO question was retrospective and observational in nature. With the use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for evaluating the data related to the outcomes of mortality and infectious complications, the quality of the data for this specific PICO question suffers because of risk of bias and imprecision. Bias was assigned because of the majority of the studies use historical controls. Imprecision was determined because of the very low numbers of events seen within the comparator group. Because of these factors, the overall quality of evidence has been determined to be very low. 

**PICO Question 2**

With the use of the GRADE framework for evaluating the data related to the outcomes of mortality and infectious complications, one randomized prospective study was specific to this PICO question, which represented approximately 7% of the total pooled data, with the remainder of the data being retrospective and observational in nature. No serious inconsistency was detected; however, serious concerns for risk of bias and imprecision were noted among the representative studies. The inconsistency in study design and data reporting lowered the grade for this PICO. Therefore, the overall quality of evidence was considered very low by the committee. 

**PICO Question 3**

With the use of the GRADE framework for evaluating the data related to the outcomes of mortality and infectious complications, there was only one prospective observational study for this PICO, and this article included small numbers of participants (14 patients) that were not managed with distal rectal washout (DRW), without a comparator group. The overwhelming data related to this PICO question were retrospective and observational in nature. No serious risk of bias was detected; however, inconsistency among the studies in design and data reporting lowered the grade for this PICO question. Therefore, the overall quality of evidence was considered very low by the committee.

**Qualitative Synthesis and Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-Analysis)**

Please refer to the original guideline document for details of the qualitative synthesis and quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) performed for each PICO question.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The Population (P), Intervention (I), Comparator (C) and Outcome (O) questions were defined as follows: 

**PICO Question 1 **

In patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal rectal injuries (P), should proximal diversion (I) be performed versus no proximal diversion with primary repair (if feasible) (C) to decrease the incidence of complications (O)? 

**PICO Question 2 **

In patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal rectal injuries (P), should presacral drainage (I) versus no presacral drainage (C) be performed to decrease the incidence of complications (O)? 

**PICO Question 3 **

In patients with nondestructive penetrating extraperitoneal rectal injuries (P), should distal rectal washout be performed (I) versus no distal rectal washout (C) to decrease the incidence of complications (O)?

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Practice Management Guidelines Section provided detail-oriented peer review of this article.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Overall, in the literature, the diversion group had nearly a 50% reduction (diversion, 8.8% vs. nondiversion, 18.2%) of overall infectious complications.

## Potential Harms



Overall, in the literature, there is no reported mortality in the nondiversion group (0 of 26), while the diversion group has a mortality rate of 1.7% (9 of 523). Unfortunately, it is unclear as to whether death in these patients was specifically related to the complications of the rectal injury or is related to overall trauma burden to include hemorrhagic shock.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) is a multi-disciplinary professional society committed to improving the care of injured patients. The Ad hoc Committee for Practice Management Guideline Development of EAST develops and disseminates evidence-based information to increase the scientific knowledge needed to enhance patient and clinical decision-making, improve health care quality, and promote efficiency in the organization of public and private systems of health care delivery. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the opinions expressed and statements made in this publication reflect the authors' personal observations and do not imply endorsement by nor official policy of EAST. 
  * "Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."* These guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care professional or provider. Individual patients may require different treatments from those specified in a given guideline. Guidelines are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods of reasonable care that can obtain/produce the same results. While guidelines can be written that take into account variations in clinical settings, resources, or common patient characteristics, they cannot address the unique needs of each patient nor the combination of resources available to a particular community or health care professional or provider. Deviations from clinical practice guidelines may be justified by individual circumstances. Thus, guidelines must be applied based on individual patient needs using professional judgment. 
  * The recommendations are meant to inform the decision-making process and not replace clinical judgment as individual patient circumstances/ conditions may dictate variation to the suggested recommendations. The data regarding mortality related to each Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) question are questionable to the committee because the raw reporting of mortality was overwhelmingly unaccompanied by explanation of the cause of death.
