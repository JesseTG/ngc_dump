#####  Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC): The following guidance was current as of November 2017. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the original guideline document for the most current version. 


**Note from NGC** : The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information. 


The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-E) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Key Points 


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed. See Table 1 in the original guideline document for an overview of diagnosis and management of COPD. 


#####  Do not perform population-wide screening for COPD [III-C]. 


#####  Appropriate comprehensive treatment can improve symptoms and quality of life [I-A]. 


###  Diagnosis 


Consider COPD in any patient with dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production _[I-C]_ . Consider early diagnostic case finding in persons with a history of inhalation exposures known to be risk factors for COPD _[I-D]_ . 


#####  Pulmonary function testing with post-bronchodilator assessment demonstrating a reduced forced expiratory volume in the first second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio is required for diagnosis [I-C]. 


#####  Assess COPD severity by determining extent of airflow limitation (spirometry), symptom severity, and exacerbation history (see Table 5 in the original guideline document) [I-C]. 


###  Treatment 


#####  Smoking cessation is the single most important intervention to slow the rate of lung function decline, regardless of disease severity [I-C]. 


Chronic medication management includes: 


  * Bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics), selected based on symptoms and severity (see Figure 1  & Table 7 in the original guideline document), with the goal of improving symptoms and functioning and reducing exacerbations _[I-A]_ . 
  * Inhaled corticosteroids – consider adding to bronchodilators for patients with frequent exacerbations despite bronchodilator therapy _[I-A]_ or with features suggestive of asthma-COPD overlap _[II-D]_ . 
  * Supplemental oxygen if resting oxygen saturation ≤88% or arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO  2  ) ≤ 55 mm Hg _[I-A]_ . 




Acute exacerbation medication management includes bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists and anticholinergics) _[I-C]_ , systemic corticosteroid therapy _[I-A]_ , and antibiotics _[II-A]_ based on clinical indications (see Table 9 in the original guideline document). Empiric antibiotics are recommended for patients with increased sputum purulence plus either increased dyspnea or increased sputum volume _[I-A]_ . Sputum culture is not routinely recommended _[III-D]_ . 


#####  Pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered for all patients with functional impairment [I-A]. 


Surgical and minimally invasive options include bullectomy, lung volume reduction procedures, and lung transplantation _[II-B]_ . Life expectancy should be incorporated into shared decision making regarding the potential benefits of surgery _[II-D]_ . Pulmonary consultation is recommended prior to consideration of invasive options _[I-D]_ . 


#####  Palliative care should be discussed with patients with advanced COPD. Doing so may help limit unnecessary and burdensome personal and societal costs and invasive approaches [I-C]. 


###  Definitions 


####  Levels of Evidence 


  1. Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials 
  2. Randomized controlled trials 
  3. Systematic review of non-randomized controlled trials or observational studies, non-randomized controlled trials, group observation studies (e.g., cohort, cross-sectional, case-control) 
  4. Individual observation studies (case study or case series) 
  5. Opinion of expert panel 




####  Strength of Recommendation 


  1. Generally should be performed 
  2. May be reasonable to perform 
  3. Generally should not be performed

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search**

The team began the search of literature by accepting the results of a systematic literature review performed in 2014:

  * VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Working Group, Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. Dec. 2014. (Searched literature from January 2005 through February 2014.) (See the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) 



To update those results, they performed a systematic search of literature on Medline and in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the time period 1/1/14–9/8/16.

The major search term was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The searches were for guidelines, controlled trials (including meta-analyses), and cohort studies, for literature on humans in the English language. Within these parameters individual searches were performed for the following topics:

  1. Etiology: smoking, particulate inhalation exposures, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, life expectancy based on forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)/Body-mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise (BODE) 
  2. Screening: questionnaires, pulmonary function testing/spirometry 
  3. Diagnosis: History (risk factors, symptoms), physical exam 
  4. Diagnostic studies: pulmonary function tests (PFTs), alpha-1 antitrypsin level, chest X-ray, 6-minute walk test, chest computed tomography (CT) 
  5. Diagnostic classification: Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classes, Medical Research Council (MRC) or Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, BODE index 
  6. Definition and diagnosis: acute exacerbation 
  7. Other diagnoses not included in C–F above 
  8. Comorbid diseases (increased risk) 
  9. Prevention: smoking cessation, vaccination (influenza, pneumococcus) 
  10. Prevention: irritant avoidance 
  11. Pharmacologic treatment: bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids 
  12. Treatment: supplemental oxygen 
  13. Treatment: pulmonary rehabilitation 
  14. Nutrition 
  15. Treatment: complementary and alternative medicine 
  16. Treatment: mental health, psychosocial support 
  17. Treatment: acute exacerbation – outpatient management, hospitalization 
  18. Referral to pulmonary subspecialist 
  19. Surgical treatment: lung volume reduction surgery, lung transplantation 
  20. Treatment: follow up care, monitoring, chronic disease management 
  21. Treatment: palliative care 
  22. Other "treatments" not in I–U above 
  23. Other not in A–V above 



The search was conducted in components of a formal problem structure (outlined above). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. The search was a single cycle.

A more formal presentation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as the detailed search strategies, are presented in the methodological appendix (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

**Literature Review and Assessment**

Members of the guideline team reviewed the publications identified to be relevant to specific topics in order to select those with best evidence. Criteria to identify overall best evidence included relevance of the study setting and population, study design, sample size, measurement methods (variables, measures, data collection), intervention methods (appropriateness, execution), appropriateness of analyses, and clarity of description.

Beginning with best evidence identified by the VA/DoD systematic literature review, team members checked publications identified in the more recent search (1/1/14–9/8/16) to determine whether better evidence was available. Team members also had the option of considering very recent literature (published since 9/8/16) in determining whether even better evidence was available.

## Number of Source Documents



The review process resulted in 56 studies identified as presenting best evidence on a topic by either the VA/DoD literature review or the review of more recent evidence.

The number of publications identified is presented in Section IV of the accompanying Literature Review Methods and Results (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Strength of Recommendation**

  1. Generally should be performed 
  2. May be reasonable to perform 
  3. Generally should not be performed 



## Cost Analysis



Cost-effectiveness of lung volume reduction surgery is not demonstrated for even the most favorable subgroup (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] patients with upper lobe emphysema and reduced exercise capacity) unless outcomes are expected to remain favorable for 10 years.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



A draft of this guideline was reviewed in clinical conferences and by distribution for comment within departments and divisions of University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) to which the content is most relevant: Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, General Medicine, Geriatric Medicine, Obstetrics & Gynecology (Women's Health), and Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine. The draft was revised based on comments from these groups.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is responsive to multiple treatments. Appropriate comprehensive treatment can improve patients' quality of life and prognosis.

Refer to the "Clinical Background and Rationale for Recommendations" section of the original guideline document for the benefits of specific interventions. 

## Potential Harms



**Long-Acting Beta-2-Agonists (LABAs) and Anticholinergics**

  * _LABAs_. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel recommended that LABAs not be used as single-agent therapy in asthma (see [University of Michigan Health System [UMHS] Asthma guideline](http://www.med.umich.edu/1info/FHP/practiceguides/asthma.html "University of Michigan Health System \(UMHS\) Web site")). However, for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), LABAs may still be used as single-agent therapy without an inhaled corticosteroid. While LABAs may increase blood pressure and heart rate, data for COPD patients from the TORCH study (a three-year trial in COPD patients of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol combination versus fluticasone alone, salmeterol alone, or placebo), found no increased risk of all-cause death or cardiovascular death in the salmeterol group. These data further underscore the importance of distinguishing asthma from COPD. 
  * _Anticholinergics_. Anticholinergic drugs may worsen symptoms and signs associated with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, or bladder-neck obstruction and should be used with caution in patients with any of these conditions. Concerns about cardiovascular effects have diminished. Initially a meta-analysis suggested that inhaled anticholinergics (ipratropium and tiotropium) were associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke among patients with COPD. However, since then, data from the UPLIFT study (a four-year, placebo controlled trial of tiotropium) found no significant increase in MI or stroke in the tiotropium treated group. 



**Inhaled Glucocorticosteroids (ICS)**

  * Withdrawal from treatment with ICS can lead to a short term increase in exacerbations in some patients. 
  * An increase in the frequency of pneumonia has been reported in COPD patients using ICS, particularly in patients age 65 and older. The frequency of reported pneumonia appears to be approximately double in several studies comparing ICS/LABA combinations versus placebo in COPD. However, in the largest published mortality study in COPD, no increase in pulmonary related deaths was noted in the ICS/LABA combination therapy group as compared to placebo. In patients with COPD being treated with ICS, particularly those age 65 and older, consider the possible increased risk of pneumonia and maintain a lower threshold for considering a diagnosis of pneumonia when patients present with increased symptoms. 
  * ICS may also increase a patient's risk for cataracts or glaucoma. Consider regular eye exams for patients using these medications. Patients using ICS should also be warned about the possibility of oral candidiasis and vocal changes. Rinsing the mouth after administration of ICS should be encouraged. 
  * Decrease in bone density is a theoretical risk of this class of medication, but available long-term data suggest there is no meaningful association between ICS use and decreased bone mineral density in this patient population.
