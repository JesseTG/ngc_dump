# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Guideline Review**

The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team's project coordinator searched an established list of Web sites for guidelines and other relevant content published between 2006 and 2015. This list was compiled based on knowledge of evidence-based practice Web sites and recommendations from the literature, and included key Web sites related to tobacco addiction and treatment interventions. Detailed information about the search strategy for existing guidelines, including the list of websites searched and inclusion criteria, is available at [www.rnao.ca](http://www.rnao.ca "Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario \(RNAO\) Web site"). Guidelines were also identified by members of the RNAO expert panel. 

**Systematic Review**

The RNAO research team and a health sciences librarian developed a comprehensive search strategy based on inclusion and exclusion criteria created with the RNAO expert panel. The team searched the following databases for relevant articles published in English between 2006 and 2015: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. In addition to this systematic search, expert panel members were asked to review their personal libraries for key articles not found in these databases.

Detailed information about the search strategy for the systematic review, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria and search terms, is available in the guideline search strategy document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

Retrieved articles were divided equally between two nursing research associates (NRA), who are nurses holding master's degrees. Each NRA independently assessed the eligibility of the studies according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The RNAO's Best Practice Guideline program manager, involved in supporting the RNAO expert panel, resolved disagreements between NRAs. 

## Number of Source Documents



Six guidelines and 53 studies were selected to inform the recommendations and discussions of evidence. See the flow diagrams in Appendix C in the original guideline document for more information on the review process and the bibliography of all included studies (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Guideline Review**

Members of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guideline development team critically appraised six international guidelines using the _Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II_. Refer to the original guideline document for a list of the selected guidelines. 

**Systematic Review**

Quality appraisal scores for 26 articles (a random sample of 10 percent of articles eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal) were independently assessed by each Nursing Research Associate (NRA). Acceptable inter-rater agreement (kappa statistic K=0.88) justified proceeding with quality appraisal and data extraction, and the remaining studies were again divided equally between the NRAs (Fleiss, Levin, & Paik, 2003). The NRAs also completed a final summary of literature findings. The comprehensive data tables and summary were provided to all RNAO expert panel members for review and discussion. 

A complete bibliography of all full-text articles screened for inclusion is available (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Guideline Development Process**

For this guideline, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) assembled a panel of experts who represent a range of sectors and practice areas. A systematic review of the evidence was based on the purpose and scope, and was supported by the four research questions listed below. The systematic review captured relevant peer-reviewed literature and guidelines published between 2006 and 2015. The following research questions were established to guide the systematic review: 

  1. In patients who use tobacco, which screening and assessment methods used by health-care professionals are most effective in promoting harm reduction, quit attempts, smoking cessation and preventing relapse? 
  2. In patients who use tobacco, which treatment and management interventions/strategies used by health-care professionals are most effective in treating tobacco dependence, nicotine withdrawal and promoting harm reduction, smoking cessation and preventing relapse? 
  3. For health-care professionals, what education is required to deliver effective care for patients regarding tobacco dependency treatment? 
  4. In healthcare organizations, what systematic approaches and mechanisms support effective uptake of tobacco use and nicotine dependence interventions by health-care professionals? 



The RNAO expert panel's mandate was to develop an evidence-based best practice guideline that will provide nurses and other health-care providers with current best practices for engaging clients who use tobacco. The recommendations in this guideline aim to bridge the identified gap between current practice and evidence-based practice.

This edition (2017) is the result of the expert panel's work to integrate the most current and best evidence into the recommendations and provide supporting evidence.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Not applicable

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Stakeholder reviewers for Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) guidelines are identified in two ways. First, stakeholders are recruited through a public call issued on the [RNAO Web site](http://rnao.ca/bpg/get-involved/stakeholder "Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario \(RNAO\) Web site"). Second, key individuals and organizations with expertise in the guideline topic area are identified by the RNAO guideline development team and expert panel and directly invited to participate in the review.

Reviewers are asked to read a full draft of the guideline and participate in the review prior to its publication. Stakeholders submit their feedback by completing an online questionnaire. Stakeholders are asked the following questions about each recommendation:

  * Is this recommendation clear? 
  * Do you agree with this recommendation? 
  * Does the evidence support this recommendation? 
  * Does this recommendation apply to all roles, regions, and practice settings? 



The online questionnaire also gives stakeholders an opportunity to include comments and feedback for each section of the guideline.

The RNAO guideline development team compiles the submissions and prepares a summary of the feedback. The RNAO expert panel reviews and considers all feedback and, if necessary, modifies the content and recommendations in the guideline prior to publication to address the feedback. Stakeholder reviewers consent to the publication of their names and contact details in the guideline.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * There is strong evidence suggesting that tobacco interventions contribute to reduced health-care costs and increased quality of life for those who quit or reduce their use (refer to Appendix E: The Benefits of Quitting Smoking in the original guideline document). For example, brief interventions with clients can lead to greater cessation and reduction rates and contribute to preventing illness and premature death. Therefore, interventions with clients who use tobacco have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use. 
  * Through implementation of tobacco interventions, health-care providers can contribute to reducing tobacco use, which is the single greatest preventable cause of death in the world today. 
  * Exposure to training makes educators more likely to develop and integrate tobacco-related content and competencies into their teaching. 
  * Evidence from a systematic review and other studies from Europe suggest that smoke-free legislation benefits entire populations by promoting the downward trend in tobacco use prevalence and by influencing positive behaviour change outcomes with regard to an increase in the number of quit attempts. 
  * Implementing comprehensive tobacco-free policies in all health-care settings provides a supportive environment for both clients and health-care staff to reduce or quit their tobacco use. 



## Potential Harms


  * Withdrawal symptoms from nicotine may include strong cravings; mood changes, such as anxiety and depression; restlessness; insomnia; increased appetite; and lack of mental focus. 
  * Problems with pharmacotherapy, such as under-dosing, side effects, compliance challenges, or premature discontinuation. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications



At this time, the use of varenicline should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to insufficient evidence regarding its safety and efficacy as a tobacco cessation intervention in pregnant women.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * These guidelines are not binding on nurses or the organizations that employ them. The use of these guidelines should be flexible, and based on individual needs and local circumstances. They neither constitute a liability nor discharge from liability. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the contents at the time of publication, neither the authors nor the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) give any guarantee as to the accuracy of the information contained in them nor accept any liability, with respect to loss, damage, injury or expense arising from any such errors or omission in the contents of this work. 
  * This nursing Best Practice Guideline (BPG) is a comprehensive document that provides resources for evidence-based nursing practice. It is not intended to be a manual or "how to" guide, but rather a tool to guide best practices and enhance decision-making for nurses and other health-care providers working with older adults who have delirium, dementia, and/or depression. The guideline should be reviewed and applied in accordance with both the needs of individual organizations or practice settings and the needs and preferences of persons and their families accessing the health system for care and services. In addition, the guideline offers an overview of appropriate structures and supports for providing the best possible evidence-based care. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



Guideline implementation at the point of care is multi-faceted and challenging; it takes more than awareness and distribution of guidelines to get people to change how they practice. Guidelines must be adapted for each practice setting in a systematic and participatory way, to ensure recommendations fit the local context. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario's (RNAO's) _Toolkit: Implementation of Best Practice Guidelines_ provides an evidence-informed process based on implementation science for successful uptake of the guidelines (see Appendix K: Description of the _Toolkit_ in the original guideline document). 

The critical success factors identified in the _Toolkit_ include: 

  * Leaders at all levels are committed to supporting guideline implementation. 
  * Guidelines are selected for implementation through a systematic, participatory process. 
  * Stakeholders for whom the guidelines are relevant are identified and engaged in the implementation. 
  * A comprehensive readiness assessment is required prior to guideline implementation. 
  * Guidelines are customized to the local context. 
  * Barriers and facilitators to guideline implementation are identified, monitored and where possible, mitigation strategies are implemented. 
  * Interventions to promote uptake of the guidelines are selected. 
  * Guideline implementation is systematically monitored and sustained. 
  * Evaluation of the guidelines' impact is embedded in the process. 
  * There are adequate resources to complete all aspects of the implementation. 



The _Toolkit_ uses the "Knowledge-to-Action" framework to demonstrate the process steps required for knowledge inquiry and synthesis. It also guides the adaptation of the new knowledge, such as guidelines, to the local context. This framework suggests identifying and using knowledge tools to identify gaps and to begin the process of tailoring the new knowledge to local settings.

RNAO is committed to widespread dissemination and implementation of its BPGs. RNAO uses a coordinated approach for dissemination, incorporating a variety of strategies, including:

  * The Nursing Best Practice Champions Network®, which develops the capacity of individual nurses to foster awareness, engagement, and adoption of BPGs; 
  * Nursing Order Sets, which provide clear, concise, actionable intervention statements derived from the BPGs' practice recommendations that can be readily embedded within electronic health records, but may also be used in paper-based or hybrid environments; and 
  * The Best Practice Spotlight Organization® (BPSO®) designation, which supports implementation at the organization and system levels. BPSOs focus on developing evidence-based cultures with the specific mandate to implement, evaluate, and sustain multiple RNAO BPGs. 



In addition, RNAO offers capacity-building learning institutes on specific BPGs and their implementation annually. Information about the full range of RNAO implementation strategies can be found at:
