# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



#####  Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC): The following guidance was current as of May 2014. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the original guideline document for the most current version. 


**Note from NGC** : The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the original guideline document for additional information. 


The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


#####  Initiate treatment immediately. Patients without contraindications to anticoagulation should begin treatment at time of diagnosis [IA]. If pulmonary embolism (PE) is clinically likely, initiation of anticoagulation should not await testing; if only deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is suspected and testing will be prompt, initiation may await testing. Therapeutic levels of anticoagulation should be achieved as quickly as possible. If warfarin is used for anticoagulation, initiate it on treatment day 1 simultaneous to initiation of low molecular weight heparin. Other oral agents may not require bridging treatment with heparin. 


###  Diagnosis 


**Deep Venous Thrombosis** (Lower Extremity DVT) 


> #####  Clinical likelihood estimation. Symptoms and signs alone are not adequately sensitive or specific for diagnosis or exclusion of DVT but clinical likelihood estimation based on symptoms and signs is a necessary step in the testing strategy [IA]. 
> 
> #####  Venous color duplex Doppler ultrasound imaging. This imaging is the standard for diagnosis [IA]. 


####  Pulmonary Embolism 


> D-dimer testing must be interpreted in the context of pretest probability _[IC]_ . D-dimer testing alone is not adequately sensitive or specific to diagnose or exclude PE _[IIIC]_ . See Figure 1 in the original guideline document. 
> 
> ######  Diagnostic testing determined by clinical likelihood estimation. The diagnostic approach differs depending on prior probability (see Figure 1, Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, and Appendix A in the original guideline document). Low probability patients with negative D-dimer require no further testing [IA]. Others should generally undergo computed tomography (CT) scanning [IA]. High or intermediate probability patients with negative CT or low probability patients with CT positive for sub- or segmental PE require further investigation (see text in the original guideline document) [IA]. 


###  Treatment 


####  Heparin 


> #####  Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH is preferred for initial treatment over unfractionated heparin (UFH) or fondaparinux due to better safety and outcomes [IA]. 
> 
> #####  Outpatient use of LMWH for DVT. LMWH is appropriate for most patients with DVT to use at home [IIA]. Some require initial brief hospital admission and stabilization. Clinically stable patients not at elevated risk due to comorbidities can be managed entirely as outpatients using LMWH. 
> 
> #####  Unfractionated heparin. UFH is no longer first line therapy. If UFH is used, it should be initiated and dosed in a structured manner (see Appendix B in the original guideline document) [IIA]. 
> 
> #####  Minimum time period. When warfarin is chosen as an oral agent, continue heparin (LMWH or UFH) until either international normalized ratio (INR) is optimally >2.0 or for at least five days to minimize risk of extension of thrombosis or occurrence/recurrence of embolism [IB]. 
> 
> ######  If heparin contraindicated. When heparin is contraindicated (bleeding risk or drug sensitivity), consider a nonheparin anticoagulant agent (e.g., argatroban) [IIB]. If anticoagulation is contraindicated, place inferior vena cava filter to prevent pulmonary embolization [IIB]. 


**Vitamin K antagonist: warfarin** . Patients should begin warfarin on day 1 of heparin, and INRs should optimally be  >2.0 before discontinuation of heparin _[IA,B]_ . Start warfarin at the anticipated therapeutic dose _[IC]_ . 


#####  If warfarin contraindicated. Patients who can receive heparin but cannot take warfarin (e.g., during pregnancy) may be anticoagulated with full-dose subcutaneous heparin [IA], preferably LMWH. 


#####  Direct factor Xa inhibitors: rivaroxaban, apixaban. For selected patients (see text in the original guideline document) begin rivaroxaban or apixaban as immediate monotherapy. See Table 12 in the original guideline document [IB]. 


#####  Aggressive therapy. Patients with "massive" proximal DVT producing severe limb swelling and pain, or patients with "massive" PE producing shock or systemic hypoperfusion, may be candidates for emergent thrombolytic therapy or (in the case of DVT) thrombectomy. Such patients should be discussed with a consultant immediately [IID]. 


#####  Duration of therapy. Most patients with VTE should be anticoagulated for 3 months [IB].

###  Definitions: 


####  Levels of Evidence 


  1. Randomized controlled trials 
  2. Controlled trials, no randomization 
  3. Observational studies 
  4. Opinion of expert panel 




####  Strength of Recommendation 


  1. Generally should be performed 
  2. May be reasonable to perform 
  3. Generally should not be performed

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The initial prospective literature searches for this project were performed on MEDLINE in 1996, 1997, 2002, and 2008. The current update is based on a supplemental literature search performed on MEDLINE in May 2013. Literature published since January 2008 was searched. The team also reviewed the overlapping literature search results published in the American College of Chest Physician evidence-based clinical practice guidelines "Diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)" and "Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease" published in 2012.

The specified population was adults. Major key words were: pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis thrombophlebitis (includes venous thromboembolism, thromboembolism, and venous thrombosis), guidelines, controlled trials, meta-analyses. Additional search terms for diagnosis were: primary risk factors (hereditary predisposition for clotting, estrogen [women], tobacco, etc.), acquired risk factors (malignancy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, etc.), duplex venous scan, pulmonary angiography, V/Q scan, arterial blood gasses (O2 saturation), computed tomography, CT angiography, CT venography, magnetic resonance imaging, risk scores for DVT, risk scores for PE, D-dimer, pulmonary hypertension – embolism, and pregnancy and VTE diagnosis. Additional search terms for treatment were: low molecular weight heparin, heparin, warfarin, oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, bivalirudin), fondaparinux, idraparinux, factor 10 testing, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, vena cava filter, temporary filter, emergency room treatment, indications for angiographic embolism removal, indications for ECMO, indications for thrombolytic, indications for iliofemoral DVT thrombolysis, pregnancy and VTE treatment, nonpharmacologic modalities of DVT treatment (e.g., sequential compression device, compression stockings/hose, physical therapy), DVT and PE prophylaxis after treatment (secondary prevention), treatment of late complications: pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome (edema). Detailed search terms and strategy are available upon request.

The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with very recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



Conclusions were based on prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) if available, to the exclusion of other data; if RCTs were not available, observational studies were admitted to consideration. If no such data were available for a given link in the problem formulation, expert opinion was used to estimate effect size.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Strength of Recommendation**

  1. Generally should be performed 
  2. May be reasonable to perform 
  3. Generally should not be performed 



## Cost Analysis



Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is less costly in overall treatment expense though its acquisition cost is higher. Shorter, or even no, hospital stays account for some of that advantage. However, even in the inpatient setting the costs of intravenous (IV) administration and monitoring make unfractionated heparin (UFH) costlier than LMWH.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Drafts of this guideline were reviewed in clinical conferences and by distribution for comment within departments and divisions of the University of Michigan Medical School to which the content is most relevant: Cardiology, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, General Medicine, Nuclear Medicine, Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Radiology, Surgery, and Vascular Surgery. The final version was endorsed by the Clinical Practice Committee of the University of Michigan Faculty Group Practice and the Executive Committee for Clinical Affairs of the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of evidence is identified and graded for select recommendations (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

Conclusions were based on prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) if available, to the exclusion of other data; if RCTs were not available, observational studies were admitted to consideration. If no such data were available for a given link in the problem formulation, expert opinion was used to estimate effect size.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the upper and lower extremity, pulmonary embolism (PE), or both venous thromboembolism (VTE)

## Potential Harms



  * Complications of anticoagulation include major bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and warfarin-induced skin necrosis. 
  * Patients taking warfarin should be aware of the effect of both diet and drug interactions on their anticoagulation status. Information on dietary sources of vitamin K that can reduce the effect of warfarin should be provided as part of patient education, as should warning about over the counter (OTC) vitamin supplementation. Since the list of medications that interact with warfarin is lengthy, anticoagulated patients should be advised to consult with their physician and/or a pharmacologist before taking any prescription or OTC medications, and be given a written list of potential interactions (such as a package insert or patient education sheet). 
  * Careful monitoring of unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy must be performed at regular intervals to ensure that this agent is effective and safe. 
  * D-dimer levels increase normally during pregnancy, thus using the standard threshold values for "abnormal" results in a high false positive rate. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications


  * Contraindications to anticoagulation 
    * Fresh surgical wound 
    * Active gastrointestinal (GI) or other bleeding (not occult blood) 
    * Recent hemorrhage cerebrovascular accident (CVA) 
    * Multiple/major trauma 
    * Recent neurosurgery 
    * Inability or unwillingness to comply with oral anticoagulation 
    * Pregnancy and impending delivery date 
  * Use of warfarin is contraindicated during pregnancy and can cause birth defects. 
  * Bleeding risk or drug sensitivity are contraindications to heparin. 
  * Contraindications to computed tomography angiography (CTA) include renal disease, severe contrast allergy and radiation dose concern. 
  * Contraindications to outpatient treatment are detailed in Table 9 in the original guideline document.
