# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Levels of evidence ( **I–V** ) and grades of recommendation ( **A–F** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


**Note** : These recommendations and clinical practice guidelines are based on the scientific literature published prior to August 2016. 


###  Pathoanatomical Features/Differential Diagnosis 


Clinicians should perform assessments and identify clinical findings in patients with neck pain to determine the potential for the presence of serious pathology (e.g., infection, cancer, cardiac involvement, arterial insufficiency, upper cervical ligamentous insufficiency, unexplained cranial nerve dysfunction or fracture), and refer for consultation as indicated. ( **Grade of Recommendation: A** ) 


###  Imaging 


Clinicians should utilize existing guidelines and appropriateness criteria in clinical decision making regarding referral or consultation for imaging studies for traumatic and nontraumatic neck pain in the acute and chronic stages. ( **Grade of Recommendation: A** ) 


###  Examination 


####  Outcome Measures 


Clinicians should use validated self-report questionnaires for patients with neck pain, to identify a patient's baseline status and to monitor changes relative to pain, function, disability, and psychosocial functioning. ( **Grade of Recommendation: A** ) 


####  Activity Limitations and Participation Measures 


Clinicians should utilize easily reproducible activity limitation and participation restriction measures associated with the patient's neck pain to assess the changes in the patient's level of function over the episode of care. ( **Grade of Recommendation: F** ) 


####  Physical Impairment Measures 


When evaluating a patient with neck pain over an episode of care, clinicians should include assessments of impairments of body function that can establish baselines, monitor changes over time, and be helpful in clinical decision making to rule in or rule out (1) neck pain with mobility deficits, including cervical active range of motion (ROM), the cervical flexion-rotation test, and cervical and thoracic segmental mobility tests; (2) neck pain with headache, including cervical active ROM, the cervical flexion-rotation test, and upper cervical segmental mobility testing; (3) neck pain with radiating pain, including neurodynamic testing, Spurling's test, the distraction test, and the Valsalva test; and (4) neck pain with movement coordination impairments, including cranial cervical flexion and neck flexor muscle endurance tests. Clinicians should include algometric assessment of pressure pain threshold for classifying pain. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


###  Diagnosis/Classification 


Clinicians should use motion limitations in the cervical and upper thoracic regions, presence of cervicogenic headache, history of trauma, and referred or radiating pain into an upper extremity as useful clinical findings for classifying a patient with neck pain into the following categories: 


  * Neck pain with mobility deficits 
  * Neck pain with movement coordination impairments (including whiplash-associated disorder [WAD]) 
  * Neck pain with headaches (cervicogenic headache) 
  * Neck pain with radiating pain (radicular) 




( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


###  Interventions 


####  Neck Pain with Mobility Deficits 


#####  Acute 


For patients with **acute** neck pain with mobility deficits: 


Clinicians should provide thoracic manipulation, a program of neck ROM exercises, and scapulothoracic and upper extremity strengthening to enhance program adherence. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians may provide cervical manipulation and/or mobilization. ( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


#####  Subacute 


For patients with **subacute** neck pain with mobility deficits: 


Clinicians should provide neck and shoulder girdle endurance exercises. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians may provide thoracic manipulation and cervical manipulation and/or mobilization. ( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


#####  Chronic 


For patients with **chronic** neck pain with mobility deficits: 


Clinicians should provide a multimodal approach of the following: 


  * Thoracic manipulation and cervical manipulation or mobilization 
  * Mixed exercise for cervical/scapulothoracic regions: neuromuscular exercise (e.g., coordination, proprioception, and postural training), stretching, strengthening, endurance training, aerobic conditioning, and cognitive affective elements 
  * Dry needling, laser, or intermittent mechanical/manual traction 




( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians may provide neck, shoulder girdle, and trunk endurance exercise approaches and patient education and counseling strategies that promote an active lifestyle and address cognitive and affective factors. ( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


####  Neck Pain with Movement Coordination Impairments 


#####  Acute 


For patients with **acute** neck pain with movement coordination impairments (including WAD): 


Clinicians should provide the following: 


  * Education of the patient to 
    * Return to normal, nonprovocative preaccident activities as soon as possible 
    * Minimize use of a cervical collar 
    * Perform postural and mobility exercises to decrease pain and increase ROM 
  * Reassurance to the patient that recovery is expected to occur within the first 2 to 3 months. 




( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians should provide a multimodal intervention approach including manual mobilization techniques plus exercise (e.g., strengthening, endurance, flexibility, postural, coordination, aerobic, and functional exercises) for those patients expected to experience a moderate to slow recovery with persistent impairments. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians may provide the following for patients whose condition is perceived to be at low risk of progressing toward chronicity: 


  * A single session consisting of early advice, exercise instruction, and education 
  * A comprehensive exercise program (including strength and/or endurance with/without coordination exercises) 
  * Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) 




( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


Clinicians should monitor recovery status in an attempt to identify those patients experiencing delayed recovery who may need more intensive rehabilitation and an early pain education program. ( **Grade of Recommendation: F** ) 


#####  Chronic 


For patients with **chronic** neck pain with movement coordination impairments (including WAD): 


Clinicians may provide the following: 


  * Patient education and advice focusing on assurance, encouragement, prognosis, and pain management 
  * Mobilization combined with an individualized, progressive submaximal exercise program including cervicothoracic strengthening, endurance, flexibility, and coordination, using principles of cognitive behavioral therapy 
  * TENS 




( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


####  Neck Pain with Headaches 


#####  Acute 


For patients with **acute** neck pain with headache: 


Clinicians should provide supervised instruction in active mobility exercise. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians may provide C1-2 self-sustained natural apophyseal glide (self-SNAG) exercise. ( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


#####  Subacute 


For patients with **subacute** neck pain with headache: 


Clinicians should provide cervical manipulation and mobilization. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians may provide C1-2 self-SNAG exercise. ( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


#####  Chronic 


For patients with **chronic** neck pain with headache: 


Clinicians should provide cervical or cervicothoracic manipulation or mobilizations combined with shoulder girdle and neck stretching, strengthening, and endurance exercise. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


####  Neck Pain with Radiating Pain 


#####  Acute 


For patients with **acute** neck pain with radiating pain: 


Clinicians may provide mobilizing and stabilizing exercises, laser, and short-term use of a cervical collar. ( **Grade of Recommendation: C** ) 


#####  Chronic 


For patients with **chronic** neck pain with radiating pain: 


Clinicians should provide mechanical intermittent cervical traction, combined with other interventions such as stretching and strengthening exercise plus cervical and thoracic mobilization/ manipulation. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** ) 


Clinicians should provide education and counseling to encourage participation in occupational and exercise activities. ( **Grade of Recommendation: B** )

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The authors of this guideline revision worked with research librarians possessing expertise in systematic reviews to perform a systematic search for concepts associated with neck pain in articles published from 2007 to August 2016 related to classification, examination, and intervention strategies for neck pain consistent with previous guideline development methods related to International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) classification. Primary electronic search methods were performed using a standard structured approach from January 2007 to August 2016 in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Abstracts, PEDro, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Sources, and EMBASE, by research librarians. The search strategy guided by PICOT-SD (Population, problem, or patients [P], Intervention [I], Comparison or control [C], Outcome [O], Time [T], Study design [SD]) was designed to locate systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or narrative reviews that addressed 6 clinical areas (classification, examination, intervention, harms, prognosis, and outcome measures), when applicable contrasting with a control or comparison treatments, and used at least 1 measurement property of an outcome measure in adult patients with neck pain or musculoskeletal neck conditions in primary to tertiary settings from immediate post-treatment to long-term follow-up. The study designs included reviews on interventions and cohort/case-control trials for prognosis, diagnostic, and outcome measurement studies. Secondary reviews were identified through several grey literature sources (references within eligible citations screened for any additional references, personal files from the investigative team, and content experts). See Appendix A in the original guideline document for example search strategies and Appendix B for example search dates and results.

In addition, the guideline revision team worked with, and benefited greatly from, the efforts of members of the International Collaboration on Neck Pain (ICON), a multidisciplinary group currently producing an extensive review of the literature on neck pain. Bridging methods and decision rules were guided by recommendations established by Whitlock et al. and Robinson et al. Additionally, recent publications on the lived experiences of people with neck pain were reviewed as part of the guideline authors' deliberations and implementation when creating the final recommendations. 

In the Impairment/Function-Based Diagnosis and the Examination sections in the original guideline document, a narrative review is provided with emphasis placed on systematic reviews and meta-analyses when available. In the Interventions section, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were considered in this revision. When there was a systematic review of reviews, those appraisals were used, and literature was searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published since the end date of the published review of reviews. If a systematic review or meta-analysis published prior to January 2007 and not included in the 2008 clinical practice guideline (CPG), or published after August 2016, was identified by the authors during writing, then that article was also appraised and included using methods similar to those recommended by Robinson et al. Articles contributing to recommendations were reviewed based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria with the goal of identifying evidence relevant to physical therapist clinical decision making for adult persons with noncancer (neuromusculoskeletal) neck pain. The titles and abstracts of each article were reviewed independently by 2 members of the CPG development team for inclusion. See Appendix C in the original guideline document for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full texts were then similarly appraised to obtain the final set of articles for contribution to recommendations. The team leader provided the final decision for rare (less than 10) discrepancies that were not resolved by the review team.

The ratings of the primary sources contained in the systematic reviews or meta-analyses were used by the team in making recommendations. If the systematic reviews or meta-analyses did not provide the necessary information (e.g., study quality, participant characteristics, stage of disorder) or there were discrepancies between the reviews, the reviewers obtained the information directly from the primary source. Quality ratings used in the systematic reviews came from a variety of tools (e.g., Cochrane Risk of Bias, PEDro). Rating of the body of evidence came from other tools (e.g., Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE], Cochrane Collaboration Back and Neck Review Group), and the CPG team calibrated these ratings into high, moderate, low, and very low quality. Very low-quality evidence was not considered in this revision. Ratings of systematic reviews came from 2 tools (AMSTAR, Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews [AMSTAR] or the closely related Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN]), and these ratings were also calibrated into high, acceptable, low, and very low categories. Very low-quality reviews and findings from very low-quality primary sources were not considered in this revision. See Appendix D for a flow chart of articles and Appendix E for articles included in recommendations. Articles on topics that were not immediately relevant to the development of these recommendations, such as shockwave therapy or injection, were not subject to the systematic review process and were not included in the flow chart.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Levels of Evidence**

Since the original neck pain clinical practice guideline (CPG) was published in 2008, publication of the results of a large number of trials has coincided with an increased number of systematic reviews and reviews of reviews. The current update appraises high-level systematic reviews using updated criteria for levels of evidence and recommendations consistent with contemporary research methodology.

Individual systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and reviews of reviews were graded according to criteria adapted from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom for diagnostic, prospective, and therapeutic studies ([www.cebm.net](https://www.cebm.net "Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Web site")). In 4 teams of 2, each reviewer independently evaluated the quality of each article using a critical appraisal tool and assigned a level of evidence. A description of the grading system is provided in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field. See also Appendix F in the original guideline document for evidence level criteria details on procedures used for assigning levels of evidence (available at [www.orthopt.org](http://www.orthopt.org "Orthopaedic Section, American Physical Therapy Association \(APTA\), Inc. Web site")). Systematic review assessment of multiple systematic reviews (AMSTAR) scores are available in Appendix G, and articles containing very low-quality primary sources are listed in Appendix H (available at [www.orthopt.org](http://www.orthopt.org "Orthopaedic Section, American Physical Therapy Association \(APTA\), Inc. Web site")). 

The levels of evidence were assigned with alignment to the definitions contained in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field.

Weaker diagnostic criteria and reference standards, improper randomization, no blinding, and less than 80% follow-up may add bias and threats to validity.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



Content experts were appointed by the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) to conduct a review of the literature and to develop an updated neck pain clinical practice guideline (CPG) as indicated by the current state of the evidence in the field. The aims of the revision were to provide a concise summary of the evidence since publication of the original guideline and to develop new recommendations or revise previously published recommendations to support evidence-based practice.

The potential organizational and implementation barriers in applying the recommendations were discussed and considerations were folded into the expert opinion section following each evidence table. 

**Grades of Recommendation**

The strength of the recommendation was graded according to the confidence in the evidence and the magnitude of effect as indicated in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.

When available, a second factor, the magnitude of effect versus harm, contributed to the recommendation, and was characterized according to the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- Clinical Validation-Pilot Testing
- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The guideline has been piloted among end users through International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists (IFOMPT) member organizations, and through APTA, Inc. through a public posting.

**Guideline Review Process and Validation**

Experts in neck pain reviewed these clinical practice guidelines' (CPGs') content and methods for integrity, accuracy, and representation of the condition. The draft was also reviewed by: (1) representatives of member organizations of International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists (IFOMPT) and members of the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), Inc. through a public posting, and (2) a panel of consumer/patient representatives and external stakeholders, such as claims reviewers, medical coding experts, academic educators, clinical educators, physician specialists, and researchers. All comments, feedback, and suggestions were considered for revision. Additionally, a panel of experts in physical therapy practice guideline methodology annually review the Orthopaedic Section of the APTA's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)-based Clinical Practice Guidelines Policies and provide feedback and comments to the Clinical Practice Guidelines Coordinator and editors to improve the APTA's guidelines development and implementation processes.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

In the Impairment/Function-Based Diagnosis and the Examination sections in the original guideline document, a narrative review is provided with emphasis placed on systematic reviews and meta-analyses when available. In the Interventions section, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were considered in this revision. When there was a systematic review of reviews, those appraisals were used, and literature was searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published since the end date of the published review of reviews.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Clinical prediction rules may prove helpful toward identifying patients who may respond well to a certain treatment.

Refer to the "Evidence Update" sections and the "Evidence Statements" in the original guideline document for specific benefits of the interventions. 

## Potential Harms



  * For neck pain with mobility deficits, adverse events or side effects were rarely reported in the studies, and when reported were minor, transient, and of short duration. For manual therapy or exercise, the only consistently reported problem was a mild transient exacerbation of symptoms. For manipulation, rare but serious adverse events such as stroke or serious neurological deficits were not reported in any of the trials. Serious but rare adverse events for manipulation are known to occur. One study reported mild adverse events equal in treatment and placebo groups, including tiredness, nausea, headache, and increased pain following laser treatment. 
  * For physical therapy interventions on patients who could be classified as having neck pain with movement coordination impairments, adverse events or side effects were rarely reported in the studies, and when reported were minor, transient, and of short duration. 
  * For physical therapy interventions for neck pain with cervicogenic headache, adverse events or side effects were poorly reported in the studies, and when reported were minor, transient, and of short duration. For manual therapy or exercise, the only consistently reported problem was local discomfort or dizziness. For manipulation, rare but serious adverse events such as stroke or serious neurological deficits were not reported in any of the trials. Serious but rare adverse events for manipulation are known to occur. One study reported mild adverse events equal in treatment and placebo groups, including tiredness, nausea, headache, and increased pain following laser treatment. 
  * For physical therapy interventions for neck pain with radiating pain, adverse events or side effects were poorly reported in the studies, and when reported were minor, transient, and of short duration.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



**Statement of Intent**

These guidelines are not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. These parameters of practice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made based on clinician experience and expertise in light of the clinical presentation of the patient, the available evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences. However, it is suggested that significant departures from accepted guidelines should be documented in the patient's health records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.

Refer to "Limitations to This CPG" in the original guideline document for additional information.
