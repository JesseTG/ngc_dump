# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the level of evidence ( **Level I-III** ) and strength of the recommendations ( **Grade A-C** ) are given at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  What Is the Impact of Leiomyomas on Reproductive Outcome? 


####  Summary Statements 


  * Heterogeneous study designs, inconsistent nomenclature, continuous nature of leiomyoma size and location, and insufficient patient recruitment significantly limit the interpretation of results from existing studies that evaluate the impact of fibroids on the likelihood of achieving pregnancy and maintenance of pregnancy. 
  * There is insufficient evidence to conclude that myomas reduce the likelihood of achieving pregnancy with or without fertility treatment. ( **Grade C** ) 
  * There is insufficient evidence to determine that a specific myoma size, number, or location (excluding submucosal myomas or intramural myomas impacting the endometrial cavity contour) is associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving pregnancy or an increased risk of early pregnancy loss. ( **Grade C** ) 




###  Does Myomectomy Improve Fertility Outcomes for Women with Intramural or Subserosal Fibroids? 


####  Summary Statements 


  * There is insufficient evidence that removal of subserosal fibroids improves fertility. ( **Grade C** ) 
  * There is fair evidence that myomectomy does not impair reproductive outcomes (clinical pregnancy rates, live-birth rates) following assisted reproductive technology (ART). ( **Grade B** ) 




###  Does Myomectomy Impact the Likelihood of Pregnancy Loss? 


####  Summary Statement 


There is insufficient evidence that myomectomy (laparoscopic or open) reduces miscarriage rates. ( **Grade C** ) 


###  Does Resection of Submucosal Fibroids (Type 0, 1, or 2) Improve Fertility? 


####  Summary Statement 


There is fair evidence that hysteroscopic myomectomy for submucosal fibroids improves clinical pregnancy rates. ( **Grade B** ) 


###  Does Hysteroscopic Resection of Submucosal Myomas Affect Miscarriage Rates? 


####  Summary Statement 


There is insufficient evidence to conclude that hysteroscopic myomectomy reduces the likelihood of early pregnancy loss in women with infertility and a submucous fibroid. ( **Grade C** ) 


###  Recommendations 


  * In asymptomatic women with cavity-distorting myomas (intramural with a submucosal component or submucosal), myomectomy (open or laparoscopic or hysteroscopic) may be considered to improve pregnancy rates. 
  * Myomectomy is generally not advised to improve pregnancy outcomes in asymptomatic infertile women with nonâ€“cavity-distorting myomas. However, myomectomy may be reasonable in some circumstances, including but not limited to severe distortion of the pelvic architecture complicating access to the ovaries for oocyte retrieval. 




###  Definitions 


####  Level of Evidence 


#####  Level I 


  * Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
  * RCTs 




#####  Level II 


  * Systematic review of a combination of RCTs, controlled trials without randomization, and cohort studies 
  * Controlled trials without randomization 
  * Cohort studies 
  * Case-control studies 




#####  Level III 


  * Descriptive studies, case series, case reports, letters, nonsystematic reviews, opinions based on clinical experience, and reports of expert committees. 




####  Strength of Recommendations 


**Grade A** : There is good evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against. 


**Grade B** : There is fair evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against. 


**Grade C** : There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.

- Surgery

## Intended Users

- Physicians

## Guideline Objective(s)

## Interventions and Practices Considered



Myomectomy (open, laparoscopic, and hysteroscopic)

## Major Outcomes Considered



  * Time to pregnancy 
  * Clinical pregnancy rate 
  * Live-birth rate 
  * Miscarriage rate 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



This clinical practice guideline was based on a systematic review of the literature performed in the electronic database MEDLINE through PubMed on March 3, 2016. No limit or filter was used for the time period covered or English language, but articles were subsequently culled for English language.

A combination of the following medical subject headings or text words were used: abortion; ART; assisted reproductive techn*; birth; embolization; embolization/therapeutic; embryo transfer; endoscopic; endoscopy; fertility; fertilization in vitro; fibroid; fibroma; fibromyoma; hysteroscopy; intrauterine; intrauterine insemination; intrauterine pathology; intrauterine pathologies; in vitro fertilization; in vitro fertilisation; IUI; IVF; laparoscopic; laparoscopy; laparotomy; leiomyoma; metroplast*; miscarriage; myoma; myomect*; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; removal; reproductive techniques, assisted; uterine; uterine myomectomy; uterine neoplasms; uterus. 

Initially, titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were screened and reviewed to develop inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Table 1 in the original guideline document). Only studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed in the final analysis. Studies were eligible if they met one of the following criteria: primary evidence (clinical trials) that assessed the effectiveness of a procedure correlated with an outcome measure (pregnancy, ovulation, or live-birth rates); meta-analyses; and relevant articles from bibliographies of identified articles.

Four members of an independent task force reviewed the full articles of all citations that potentially matched the predefined selection criteria. Final inclusion or exclusion decisions were made on examination of the articles in full. Disagreements about inclusion among reviewers were discussed and resolved by consensus or arbitration after consultation with an independent reviewer/epidemiologist.

## Number of Source Documents



The electronic search and examination of reference lists from primary and review articles yielded 1,785 studies, of which 88 studies were included.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The level of the evidence was evaluated using the grading system found in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field and is assigned for each reference in the bibliography (see the original guideline document).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



The literature was reviewed to answer the following questions:

  * What is the impact of leiomyomas on reproductive outcome? 
  * Does myomectomy improve fertility outcomes for women with intramural or subserosal fibroids? 
  * Does myomectomy impact the likelihood of pregnancy loss? 
  * Does resection of submucosal fibroids (type 0, 1, or 2) improve fertility? 
  * Does hysteroscopic resection of submucosal myomas affect miscarriage rates? 



The strength of the recommendations was evaluated using the grading system found in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Strength of Recommendations**

**Grade A** : There is good evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.

**Grade B** : There is fair evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.

**Grade C** : There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendations, either for or against.

## Cost Analysis

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each summary statement that supports the recommendations (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * There is fair evidence that myomectomy (open or laparoscopic) for cavity-distorting myomas (intramural or intramural with a submucosal component) improves pregnancy rates and reduces the risk of early pregnancy loss. 
  * There is fair evidence that hysteroscopic myomectomy for cavity-distorting myomas improves clinical pregnancy rates but insufficient evidence regarding the impact of this procedure on the likelihood of live birth or early pregnancy loss. 
  * There is fair evidence that hysteroscopic myomectomy for submucosal fibroids improves clinical pregnancy rates.
