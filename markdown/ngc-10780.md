# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the rating of evidence ( **High** , **Intermediate** , **Low** , **Insufficient** ); types of recommendations ( **Evidence based** , **Formal consensus** , **Informal consensus** , **No recommendation** ); and strength of recommendations ( **Strong** , **Moderate** , **Weak** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Clinical Question 1 


####  Under what circumstances (i.e., for which patients) should metastases be biopsied or otherwise sampled to test for changes from the primary tumor with respect to endocrine receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status? 


#####  Recommendation 1. At initial presentation of metastasis from breast cancer, it is standard of care to biopsy an accessible lesion to confirm metastatic breast cancer. When evaluating the metastatic site(s), it is important to note that the results of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and/or HER2 status may have changed from the primary tumor, and these results may inform treatment decisions. Therefore, this Panel recommends retesting for ER, PR, and HER2 on â‰¥ one metastasis with careful attention to assay performance, particularly for bone metastases (see the section "Clinical Interpretation" in the original guideline document). However, for patients with documented changes in these biomarkers, data are lacking to determine whether outcomes from systemic therapy are altered when guided by biomarker test results from the metastases. The Panel informal consensus for the management of care when there is discordance of ER, PR, or HER2 results between primary and metastatic tissues is to use the ER, PR, or HER2 status from the metastasis to direct therapy, if supported by the clinical scenario and the patient's goals for care. (Type: evidence based for biomarker change from primary to metastasis, but no evidence to demonstrate that systemic therapy choices affect health outcomes when biomarker change occurs; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 2 


####  For women with metastatic breast cancer and with known endocrine receptor and HER2 status, which additional tumor markers have demonstrated clinical utility to initiate systemic therapy or direct selection of a new systemic therapy regimen? 


#####  Recommendation 2. Decisions concerning the initiation of systemic therapy or selection of systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer should be guided by ER, PR, and HER2 status, in conjunction with clinical evaluation, judgment, and the patient's goals for care. Presently, there is no evidence that therapy decisions based solely on additional biomarker results improve health outcomes; thus, decisions about initiating or selecting therapy for metastatic breast cancer should be based solely on ER, PR, and HER2 status and the specific clinical scenario. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 3 


####  For women with metastatic breast cancer and with known ER, PR, and HER2 status, which additional tumor markers have demonstrated clinical utility to guide decisions on switching to a different drug or regimen or discontinuing treatment? 


#####  Recommendation 3 


######  Recommendations for Tissue Biomarkers 


In patients who are already receiving systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer, decisions on changing to a new drug or regimen or discontinuing treatment should be based on the patient's goals for care and clinical evaluation and judgment of disease progression or response, given that there is no evidence at this time that changing therapy solely on the basis of biomarker results beyond ER, PR, and HER2 improves health outcome, quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


######  Recommendations for Circulating Tumor Markers 


In patients already receiving systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer, decisions on changing to a new drug or regimen or discontinuing treatment should be based on the patient's goals for care and clinical evaluation and judgment of disease progression or response, given that there is no evidence at this time that changing therapy solely on the basis of circulating biomarker results improves health outcome, quality of life, or cost effectiveness. (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, and CA 27-29 may be used as adjunctive assessments to contribute to decisions regarding therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Data are insufficient to recommend use of CEA, CA 15-3, and CA 27-29 alone for monitoring response to treatment. The Panel acknowledges the lack of evidence of clinical utility in support of use of these circulating biomarkers; biochemical assessments of CEA, CA 15-3, and CA 27-29 were developed before the present standards for measuring clinical utility. The recommendation for use is based on clinical experience and Panel informal consensus in the absence of studies designed to evaluate the clinical utility of the markers. As such, it is also reasonable for clinicians to not use these markers as adjunctive assessments. (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 4 


####  For biomarkers shown to have clinical utility to guide decisions on systemic therapy for metastatic disease in questions 2 and 3, what are the appropriate assays, timing, and frequency of measurement? 


#####  Recommendation 4. Decisions for systemic therapy should be influenced by ER, PR, and HER2. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recently updated the guideline addressing optimization of HER2 assays. To date, clinical utility has not been demonstrated for any additional biomarkers. (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong.)

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search Strategy**

The Expert Panel developed its recommendations based on evidence identified through online searches of Medline and the Cochrane Library (from January 2006 through August 2014, to overlap with the search end date for the 2007 guideline update on tumor markers in breast cancer [Harris et al., 2007]), and their own clinical experience. See Data Supplement 3 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for full details on the search string. A combined PubMed search was conducted for this guideline and for a similar guideline on use of biomarkers to guide decisions on systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer, with articles selected for each guideline's systematic review based on the patient population studied. Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review based on the following criteria:

Population: Women with metastatic breast cancer being considered for initiation of systemic therapy, or for changes in the drug or regimen they are receiving, with separate sub-questions and analyses on patient groups with:

  * Endocrine receptor positive disease 
  * Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), positive disease 
  * Triple negative disease 
  * And on use of tumor marker assay results to guide decisions on: 
  * First-line therapy 
  * Second- or subsequent-line therapy 



Publications in English were included if they reported rigorously conducted systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective biomarker analyses of samples from completed prospective RCTs, or prospective observational studies that directly compared outcomes of treatment decisions made on the basis of assay results with outcomes of treatment decisions made regardless of assay results.

Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were (1) meeting abstracts not subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews; (3) published in a non-English language; (4) retrospective observational studies.

## Number of Source Documents



The literature search revealed 17 articles that met criteria for further review: 11 studies reporting discordances between primary tumors and metastases in expression of hormone receptors or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that addressed the use of a biomarker to decide whether to change or continue a treatment regimen, and five prospective-retrospective studies that evaluated the clinical utility of biomarkers.

Also see Data Supplement 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) for a Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) Diagram showing exclusions and inclusions of publications identified for the systematic review.

 **Data Extraction**

Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff member, in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by one reviewer.

Data Supplements 3 and 4 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field) include results of data extraction from the literature review. Data Supplement Tables 2 through 7 provide information on key characteristics of the studies and their patient populations, on study quality assessment, and on reported outcomes. None of the included studies reported on toxicity, either of biomarker testing or of systemic therapy, for patient subgroups subdivided biomarker results. In addition, no studies reported on changes in quality-of-life outcomes attributable to biomarker testing.

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Panel Composition**

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC) and the ASCO Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group (GAG) convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, radiation oncology, and community oncology, statistician, health outcome researchers, the Practice Guidelines Implementation Network, and patient/advocacy representation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had the primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. The Panel had one face-to-face meeting and three webinars. The Co-Chairs and ASCO staff prepared a draft guideline for review and rating by the Expert Panel. The Expert Panel members are listed in Appendix Table A1 of the original guideline document.

**Guideline Development Process**

The Expert Panel met on several occasions and corresponded frequently through email; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs and ASCO staff. The purpose of the Panel meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document, which was then disseminated for external review and submitted to the _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ ( _JCO_ ) for peer review and publication.

**Development of Recommendations**

The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the principles of the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality, to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



A biomarker-based test is judged to have clinical utility if use of the test is demonstrated to result in a favorable balance of benefits to harms. If clinical care options result in similar patient survival, biomarker tests may still have clinical utility if they direct care to options that result in improved quality of life (e.g., less toxicity or inconvenience) or lower cost. A new biomarker test must be shown to contribute clinically useful information beyond that already provided by standardly used clinical or pathologic indicators, unless the new test can provide equivalent information at a lower cost, less invasively, or with less inconvenience or risk.

## Potential Harms



  * For needle biopsies of metastatic breast cancer to bone, submitting the accompanying blood clot in the specimen container separately from the fragments of bony tissue may yield viable tumor that would not have to undergo decalcification and could be used for the analysis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer metastatic to skeletal tissue. If it is not possible to test a sample that has not undergone decalcification, a negative result should be interpreted with caution, and consideration should be given to an additional and more suitable biopsy sample for testing. 
  * Caution should be used when interpreting increasing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, or CA 27-29 level during the first 4 to 6 weeks of administration of a new therapy, given that spurious early increases may occur. 
  * There have been reports of liver and renal dysfunction affecting the values of serum tumor markers, which demonstrates that multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) may confuse the interpretation of serum tumor markers. There is insufficient evidence to calibrate how MCCs may affect the results of biomarker testing.

Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO Web site and usually published in _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ ( _JCO_ ) and _Journal of Oncology Practice_.

For information on the ASCO implementation strategy, please see the [ASCO Web site](http://www.asco.org/institute-quality/implementation-strategy "ASCO Web site").

## Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest



The Expert Panel was assembled in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Conflicts of Interest Management Procedures for Clinical Practice Guidelines (summarized at <http://www.asco.org/rwc>). Members of the Panel completed the ASCO disclosure form, which requires disclosure of financial and other interests that are relevant to the subject matter of the guideline, including relationships with commercial entities that are reasonably likely to experience direct regulatory or commercial impact as a result of promulgation of the guideline. Categories for disclosure include employment; leadership; stock or other ownership; honoraria, consulting, or advisory role; speaker's bureau; research funding; patents, royalties, or other intellectual property; expert testimony; travel, accommodations, or expenses; and other relationships. In accordance with these procedures, the majority of the members of the Panel did not disclose any such relationships. Notably, one author (D.F.H.) recused himself from deliberations and Panel votes concerning recommendations for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) because of potential conflicts of interest.
