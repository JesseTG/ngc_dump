# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The strength of the recommendation (strongly recommended, recommended, or no recommendation) and the quality of the evidence (1a‒5b) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


  1. It is recommended that patients age 10 to 17 years who are expected to have a surgical procedure lasting at least 60 minutes be started at induction of anesthesia on a sequential compression device (SCD), for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), unless there are contraindications to mechanical prophylaxis (Schwenk et al., 1998 [2b]; Local Consensus, 2014 [5]; Coleridge-Smith, Hasty, & Scurr, 1990 [5]; Branchford et al., "Clinical," 2012 [5b]). See Table 1 in the original guideline document. 
  2. It is recommended that all patients age 10 to 17 years be assessed for VTE risk factors (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) and, based on that assessment, assigned to a risk category (low, moderate or high) (see Table 3 in the original guideline document): 
    1. At the time of inpatient admission, and 
    2. Reassessed at 48 to 72 hours of hospitalization 

(Branchford et al., "Risk," 2012 [4a]; Sharathkumar et al., 2012 [4a]; Local Consensus, 2014 [5]). See the Algorithm in the original guideline document. 




  3. It is recommended that VTE prophylaxis be administered based on risk category (see Table 4 in the original guideline document), as soon as feasible but within 24 hours of assessment, unless there are contraindications (see Table 1 and Table 5 in the original guideline document). See the Algorithm in the original guideline document. 

**Note** : Examples of risk factor mitigation strategies are: discontinuing peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) lines as soon as possible, treating infections, and avoiding estrogen therapy. 

  4. It is recommended, if planning to initiate pharmacologic prophylaxis: 
    1. In surgical patients seek surgical input regarding bleeding risk, prior to initiation. 
    2. Obtain hematology consultation when considering alternative pharmacologic agents 

(Alhazzani et al., 2013 [1a]; Barrera et al., 2013 [1a]; Handoll et al., 2002 [1a]; Bidlingmaier et al., 2011 [1b]; Kakkos et al., 2011 [1b]; Stem et al., 2013 [3b]; Local Consensus, 2014 [5]).

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for most recommendations (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * The risk stratification algorithm in the original guideline document may help identify patients at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and decrease unnecessary prophylaxis measures in low risk patients. 
  * VTE prophylaxis may prevent a life threatening event (pulmonary embolism) as well as chronic post-thrombotic syndrome. 



## Potential Harms


  * Adverse event rates of sequential compression device (SCD) are low and generally minor. They include discomfort/intolerance and skin abrasions. Discomfort may lead to decreased adherence. 
  * Risk assessment is easily obtained from a patient's history and therefore is non-invasive. It could be harmful if done incorrectly. 
  * Subcutaneous injections are painful for patients and required a skilled provider for administration. Appropriate mechanical prophylaxis requires patient and nurse effort. 
  * Pharmacologic prophylaxis carries a significant risk of bleeding. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications



**Contraindications to Mechanical Prophylaxis**

  * Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), suspected or existing (can use graduated compression stockings) 
  * Extremity to be used has acute fracture 
  * Extremity to be used has peripheral intravenous (PIV) access 
  * Skin conditions affecting extremity (e.g., dermatitis, burn) 
  * Unable to achieve correct fit due to patient size 



**Contraindications to Pharmacologic Prophylaxis**

**Absolute Contraindications**

  * Bleeding disorder, known or tendency 
  * Hemorrhage, evidence of or high risk of 
  * Platelet count unable to be sustained >50,000/mm3



**Relative Contraindications**

  * Intracranial mass 
  * Lumbar puncture or epidural catheter removal in prior 12 hours 
  * Neurosurgical procedure 
  * Pelvic fracture within past 48 hours 
  * Uncontrolled hypertension 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation. This Best Evidence Statement does not preclude using care modalities proven efficacious in studies published subsequent to the current revision of this document. This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients. Adherence to this Statement is voluntary. The clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient must make the ultimate judgment regarding the priority of any specific procedure.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



 **Applicability and Feasibility Issues**

There is evidence that venous thromboembolism (VTE) events are increasing in the pediatric population, and it has become evident to many providers, including medical and surgical specialists, that health care providers must do a better job of prevention. These care recommendations provide a means to assess patients at risk and mitigate that risk in the safest possible way. As the recommendations are newly developed, the feasibility of implementation has as yet been untested. Generally, the team believes implementation efforts will need to address:

  1. Education and training of staff to perform the risk assessment and review of contraindications, and to order prophylaxis 
  2. Identifying an appropriate time and place during the hospitalization to apply the recommendations 
  3. Ensuring adequate equipment and supplies 
  4. Successfully achieving patient and family buy-in 



A tool in the electronic health record (EHR) may need to be developed to improve reliable use of the recommendations.
