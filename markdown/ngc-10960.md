# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the strength of evidence ( **Class I-III** ) and strength of recommendations ( **A-C** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


  1. **For well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥38.0°C [100.4°F]), are there clinical predictors that identify patients at risk for urinary tract infection?**

#####  Level A recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level B recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level C recommendations. Infants and children at increased risk for urinary tract infection include females younger than 12 months, uncircumcised males, nonblack race, fever duration greater than 24 hours, higher fever (≥39°C), negative test result for respiratory pathogens, and no obvious source of infection. Although the presence of a viral infection decreases the risk, no clinical feature has been shown to effectively exclude urinary tract infection. Physicians should consider urinalysis and urine culture testing to identify urinary tract infection in well-appearing infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years with a fever ≥38°C (100.4°F), especially among those at higher risk for urinary tract infection. 

  2. **For well-appearing febrile infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years undergoing urine testing, which laboratory testing method(s) should be used to diagnose a urinary tract infection?**

#####  Level A recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level B recommendations. Physicians can use a positive test result for any one of the following to make a preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years: urine leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, or Gram's stain. 

#####  Level C recommendations. 

    1. Physicians should obtain a urine culture when starting antibiotics for the preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection in febrile patients aged 2 months to 2 years. 
    2. In febrile infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years with a negative dipstick urinalysis result in whom urinary tract infection is still suspected, obtain a urine culture. 
  3. **For well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥38.0°C [100.4°F]), are there clinical predictors that identify patients at risk for pneumonia for whom a chest radiograph should be obtained?**

#####  Level A recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level B recommendations. In well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥38°C [100.4°F]) and no obvious source of infection, physicians should consider obtaining a chest radiograph for those with cough, hypoxia, rales, high fever (≥39°C), fever duration greater than 48 hours, or tachycardia and tachypnea out of proportion to fever. 

#####  Level C recommendations. In well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥38°C [100.4°F]) and wheezing or a high likelihood of bronchiolitis, physicians should not order a chest radiograph. 

  4. **For well-appearing immunocompetent full-term infants aged 1 month to 3 months (29 days to 90 days) presenting with fever (≥38.0°C [100.4°F]), are there predictors that identify patients at risk for meningitis from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained?**

#####  Level A recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level B recommendations. None specified. 

#####  Level C recommendations. 

    1. Although there are no predictors that adequately identify full-term well-appearing febrile infants aged 29 to 90 days from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained, the performance of a lumbar puncture may still be considered. 
    2. In the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days diagnosed with a viral illness, deferment of lumbar puncture is a reasonable option, given the lower risk for meningitis. When lumbar puncture is deferred in the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days, antibiotics should be withheld unless another bacterial source is identified. Admission, close follow-up with the primary care provider, or a return visit for a recheck in the emergency department (ED) is needed. ( **Consensus recommendation** )

####  Strength of Recommendations 


Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines: 


**Level A recommendations** . Generally accepted principles for patient care that reﬂect a high degree of clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies). 


**Level B recommendations** . Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reﬂect moderate clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies). 


**Level C recommendations** . Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation. 


There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.

## Intended Users

- Physicians

## Guideline Objective(s)



  * To address key issues for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years presenting to the emergency department with fever 
  * To derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: 
    * For well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥38.0°C [100.4°F]), are there clinical predictors that identify patients at risk for urinary tract infection? 
    * For well-appearing febrile infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years undergoing urine testing, which laboratory testing method(s) should be used to diagnose a urinary tract infection? 
    * For well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥38.0°C [100.4°F]), are there clinical predictors that identify patients at risk for pneumonia for whom a chest radiograph should be obtained? 
    * For well-appearing immunocompetent full-term infants aged 1 month to 3 months (29 days to 90 days) presenting with fever (≥38.0°C [100.4°F]), are there predictors that identify patients at risk for meningitis from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained? 



## Target Population



Well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years presenting to the emergency department with fever

**Note** : This guideline applies to previously healthy term infants and children, appropriately immunized for age, with ages as described in each critical question. This guideline excludes neonates, prematurely born infants, and pediatric patients considered to be at high risk such as those with significant congenital abnormalities, with serious illnesses preceding the onset of fever, and in an immunocompromised state.

## Interventions and Practices Considered



  1. Urinalysis and urine culture to identify urinary tract infection 
  2. Urine leukocyte esterase, nitrites, leukocyte count, or Gram's stain to make a preliminary diagnosis of urinary tract infection 
  3. Chest radiograph to identify patients at risk for pneumonia (for immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years with no obvious source of infection, and with cough, hypoxia, rales, high fever [≥39º C], fever duration >48 hours, or tachycardia and tachypnea out of proportion to fever)
  4. Lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid to assess for meningitis 



## Major Outcomes Considered


  * Differentiation of the well-appearing febrile infant or child with a serious bacterial infection (SBI) from the febrile infant or child with a benign, usually viral infection 
  * Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of diagnostic tests 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



This clinical policy was created after careful review and critical analysis of the medical literature and was based on a systematic review of the literature. Searches of MEDLINE, MEDLINE InProcess, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database were performed. All searches were limited to English-language sources and human studies. Specific key words/phrases, years used in the searches, dates of searches, and study selection are identified under each critical question in the original guideline document. In addition, relevant articles from the bibliographies of included studies and more recent articles identified by committee members and reviewers were included.

## Number of Source Documents



 **Study Selection**

**Critical Question 1**

Three hundred seventy-three articles were identified in the search. Twenty-six articles were selected from the search results for further review, with 2 studies included for this critical question.

**Critical Question 2**

Four hundred ninety-two articles were identified in the search. One hundred nine articles were selected from the search results for further review, with 10 studies included for this critical question.

**Critical Question 3**

Four hundred seventy-three articles were identified in the search. Sixty-four articles were selected from the search results for further review, with 9 studies included for this critical question.

**Critical Question 4**

Six hundred sixty-one articles were identified in the search. Sixty-eight articles were selected from the search results for further review, with 1 study included for this critical question. Studies that did not report subgroup analysis of the specific age groups noted in the question were not included.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Assessment of Classes of Evidence**

All articles used in the formulation of this clinical policy were graded by at least 2 methodologists and assigned a Class of Evidence. Each article was assigned a design class with design 1 representing the strongest study design and subsequent design classes (i.e., design 2, design 3) representing respectively weaker study designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports, or meta-analyses (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles were then graded on dimensions related to the study's methodological features, such as randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, and generalizability. Using a predetermined process related to the study's design, methodological quality, and applicability to the critical question, articles received a final Class of Evidence grade (i.e., Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X) (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field). Articles identified with fatal flaws or that were ultimately not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade "X" and were not used in formulating recommendations for this policy. Grading was done with respect to the specific critical questions; thus, the level of evidence for any one study may vary according to the question for which it is being considered. As such, it was possible for a single article to receive different Classes of Evidence as different critical questions were answered from the same study. Question-specific Classes of Evidence grading may be found in the Evidentiary Table in the original guideline document.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



This policy is a product of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy development process, including expert review, and is based on the existing literature; when literature was not available, consensus of emergency physicians was used. 

When possible, clinically oriented statistics (e.g., likelihood ratios [LRs], number needed to treat) are presented to help the reader better understand how the results may be applied to the individual patient. For a definition of these statistical concepts, see Appendix C in the original guideline document.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



Strength of recommendations regarding each critical question were made by subcommittee members using results from strength of evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus among subcommittee members according to the following guidelines:

**Strength of Recommendations**

**Level A recommendations**. Generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).

**Level B recommendations**. Recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (e.g., based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).

**Level C recommendations**. Recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus. In instances where consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation.

There are certain circumstances in which the recommendations stemming from a body of evidence should not be rated as highly as the individual studies on which they are based. Factors such as heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, among others, might lead to such a downgrading of recommendations.

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



Expert review comments were received from emergency physicians, members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP's) Pediatric Emergency Medicine Committee. Comments were received during a 60-day open comment period, with notices of the comment period sent in an e-mail to ACEP members, published in _EM Today_ , and posted on the ACEP Web site. The responses were used to further refine and enhance this policy; however, the responses do not imply endorsement of this clinical policy.

This clinical policy was approved by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Board of Directors on January 27, 2016. 

This clinical policy was endorsed by the Emergency Nurses Association on February 29, 2016.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

Recommendations for question 1 were based on 2 Class III studies. Recommendations for question 2 were based on 2 Class II studies and 8 Class III studies. Recommendations for question 3 were based on 1 Class II study and 8 Class III studies. Recommendations for question 4 were based on 1 Class III study. 

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



See the "Potential Benefits" sections in Appendix D in the original guideline document for information on potential benefits of the specific interventions.

## Potential Harms



See the "Potential Harms" sections in Appendix D in the original guideline document for information on potential harms of the specific interventions.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Policy statements and clinical policies are the official policies of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and, as such, are not subject to the same peer review process as articles appearing in the journal. Policy statements and clinical policies of ACEP do not necessarily reflect the policies and beliefs of _Annals of Emergency Medicine_ and its editors. 
  * This policy is not intended to be a complete manual on the evaluation and management of young pediatric patients with fever but rather a focused examination of critical issues that have particular relevance to the current practice of emergency medicine. 
  * It is the goal of the Clinical Policies Committee to provide an evidence-based recommendation when the medical literature provides enough quality information to answer a critical question. When the medical literature does not contain adequate empirical data to answer a critical question, the members of the Clinical Policies Committee believe that it is equally important to alert emergency physicians to this fact. 
  * This clinical policy is not intended to represent a legal standard of care for emergency physicians. Recommendations offered in this policy are not intended to represent the only diagnostic or management options available to the emergency physician. ACEP recognizes the importance of the individual physician's judgment and patient preferences. This guideline defines for the physician those strategies for which medical literature exists to provide support for answers to the critical questions addressed in this policy.
