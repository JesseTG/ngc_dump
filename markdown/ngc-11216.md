The evidence grades ( **A-D, X** ) and evidence-based statements ( **Strong Recommendation, Recommendation, Option, and No Recommendation** ) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Statement 1a. Diagnosis of Posterior Semicircular Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) 


Clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to 1 side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down. The maneuver should be repeated with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative.

  * Value judgments: To avoid harm from ineffective treatments. The panel felt that data regarding harms and side effects from non-BPPV populations with vertigo would be applicable to the BPPV patient population 
  * Intentional vagueness: The panel recognized that there most likely is a very small subgroup of patients with severe symptoms who may need vestibular suppression until more definitive treatment can be offered (e.g., CRP) or immediately before and/or after treatment with CRP 
  * Role of patient preferences: Small 
  * Exceptions: Severely symptomatic patients refusing other treatment options and patients requiring prophylaxis for CRP 
  * Policy level: Recommendation against 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 7a. Outcome Assessment 


Clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms.

  * Role of patient preferences: Small 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: Some panel members felt that there is value in return visits to establish symptom resolution or to document objective improvement. Most other panel members felt that phone contact versus open-ended follow-up if symptoms persist or recur is sufficient 




###  Statement 7b. Evaluation of Treatment Failure 


Clinicians should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies of diagnostic outcomes in patients with BPPV and a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


####  Action Statement Profile

  * Role of patient preferences: Small 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




###  Statement 8: Education 


Clinicians should educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up.

## Clinical Algorithm(s)



An algorithm titled "Algorithm showing the relationship of guideline key action statements" is provided in the original guideline document.

# Scope

## Disease/Condition(s)



Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)

**Note** : This guideline does not discuss BPPV affecting the anterior semicircular canal, as this diagnosis is quite rare and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. It also does not discuss benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, disabling positional vertigo due to vascular loop compression in the brainstem, or vertigo that arises from changes in head position not related to gravity (i.e., vertigo of cervical origin or vertigo of vascular origin). These conditions are physiologically distinct from BPPV.

  * To improve quality of care and outcomes for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers 
  * To revise the prior guideline with an a priori determined transparent process, reconsidering a more current evidence base while taking into account advances in knowledge with respect to BPPV 



## Target Population



Patients aged 18 years or older with a suspected or potential diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)

## Interventions and Practices Considered



 **Diagnosis/Evaluation**

  1. Diagnosis of posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver 
  2. Supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV 
  3. Differential diagnosis (differentiation of BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo) 
  4. Assessment of patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search**

An information specialist conducted 2 systematic literature searches using a validated filter strategy to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since the prior guideline (2008). Search terms used were "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo"[Mesh] OR "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo"[tab] OR "Benign Positional Vertigo"[tiab] OR BPPV[tiab] OR (BPV[tiab] AND vertigo). In certain instances, targeted searches for lower-level evidence were performed to address gaps from the systematic searches identified in writing the guideline. The original search was updated from January 2008 to September 2015 to include MEDLINE, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Canadian Medical Association Database, National Health Service (NHS) Evidence ENT and Audiology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence UK, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, Guideline International Network, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Web of Science, and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database.

## Number of Source Documents



  1. The initial search for clinical practice guidelines identified 2 guidelines. Quality criteria for including guidelines were (a) an explicit scope and purpose, (b) multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement, (c) systematic literature review, (d) explicit system for ranking evidence, and (e) explicit system for linking evidence to recommendations. The final data set retained 2 guidelines that met inclusion criteria. 
  2. The initial search for systematic reviews identified 44 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that were distributed to the panel members. Quality criteria for including reviews were (a) relevance to the guideline topic, (b) clear objective and methodology, (c) explicit search strategy, and (d) valid data extraction methods. The final data set retained was 20 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that met inclusion criteria. 
  3. The initial search for RCTs identified 38 RCTs that were distributed to panel members for review. Quality criteria for including RCTs were (a) relevance to the guideline topic, (b) publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and (c) clear methodology with randomized allocation to treatment groups. The total final data set retained 27 RCTs that met inclusion criteria.

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined. Evidence-based statements reflect both the _quality of evidence_ and the _balance of benefit and harm_ that is anticipated when the statement is followed. The definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of Evidence" and "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



In developing this update of the evidence-based clinical practice guideline, the methods outlined in the third edition of the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guideline development manual were followed explicitly (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

An executive summary of the original benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline was sent to a panel of expert reviewers from the fields of general otolaryngology, otology, neurotology, neurology, family practice, nursing, physical therapy, emergency medicine, radiology, audiology, and complementary medicine who assessed the key action statements to decide if they should be kept in their current form, revised, or removed and to identify new research that might affect the guideline recommendations. The reviewers concluded that the original guideline action statements remained valid but should be updated with minor modifications. Suggestions were also made for new key action statements.

The AAO-HNSF assembled a guideline update group representing the disciplines of otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, otology, neurotology, family medicine, audiology, emergency medicine, neurology, physical therapy, advanced practice nursing, and consumer advocacy. The guideline update group had several conference calls and 1 in-person meeting, during which it defined the scope and objectives of updating the guideline, reviewed comments from the expert panel review for each key action statement, identified other quality improvement opportunities, and reviewed the literature search results.

The evidence profile for each statement in the earlier guideline was then converted into an expanded action statement profile for consistency with the current development standards. Information was added to the action statement profiles regarding the quality improvement opportunity to which the action statement pertained, the guideline panel's level of confidence in the published evidence, differences of opinion among panel members, intentional vagueness, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. New key action statements were developed with an explicit and transparent a priori protocol for creating actionable statements based on supporting evidence and the associated balance of benefit and harm. Electronic decision support software (BRIDGE-Wiz; Yale Center for Medical Informatics, New Haven, Connecticut) was used to facilitate creating actionable recommendations and evidence profiles.

The updated guideline then underwent GuideLine Implementability Appraisal to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. The guideline update group received summary appraisals and modified an advanced draft of the guideline based on the appraisal.

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The updated guideline underwent GuideLine Implementability Appraisal to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, to improve clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation. The guideline update group received summary appraisals and modified an advanced draft of the guideline based on the appraisal.

The final draft of the updated clinical practice guideline was revised according to comments received during multidisciplinary peer review, open public comment, and journal editorial peer review. A scheduled review process will occur at 5 years from publication or sooner if new compelling evidence warrants earlier consideration.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)

For benefits of specific interventions considered in the guideline, see the "Major Recommendations" field.

## Potential Harms



  * Paroxysmal positional nystagmus induced by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver carries the risk of provoking temporary symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). 
  * With respect to complications of treatment, the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) is associated with mild and generally self-limiting adverse effects in about 12% of those treated. Some patients may experience an immediate falling sensation within 30 minutes after the maneuver and may benefit from counseling prior to the maneuver. Serious complications from the CRP have not been identified in multiple randomized controlled trials. The most commonly encountered complications include nausea, vomiting, fainting, and conversion to lateral canal BPPV during the course of treatment (so-called canal switch or conversion). Canal conversion occurs in about 6% to 7% of those treated with CRP, underscoring the importance of recognizing the lateral canal variant of BPPV and the need for more unique and different CRPs. Another potential side effect after the CRP is postural instability that can last 24 hours with a tendency to fall backward or forward. 
  * Patients who elect observation should be informed about the possibility of longer duration of symptoms when compared with patients receiving active treatment maneuvers. There is also a potential for higher recurrence rates of another episode of BPPV with the observation option. 



For additional harms associated with specific interventions considered in the guideline, see the "Major Recommendations" field.

# Contraindications

## Contraindications



  * Some patients were unable to tolerate the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) because of cervical spine problems, while others complained of headache or pain in the neck after treatments. Patients with any of the relative contraindications, including cervical spondylosis, known cervical disk disease, and/or unstable cardiac conditions, may be candidates for observation rather than active treatment. 
  * Anecdotally, several investigators have suggested that the CRP should be applied cautiously in patients with cervical spine disease, certain vascular conditions, retinal detachment, and other contraindications to its performance. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * The clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions but are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible provider, in light of all circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. 
  * Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than what might be expected with a recommendation. Options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. 
  * Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline update group sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



**Implementation Considerations**

The complete guideline is published as a supplement to _Otolaryngology –Head and Neck Surgery_, which will facilitate reference and distribution. An executive summary will be published highlighting key recommendations from the guideline to facilitate information dissemination. Portions of the guideline will be presented at various clinical meetings, including planned presentation in a mini-seminar at the annual meeting of the Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Existing brochures and publications by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline recommendations. A visual depiction of the anticipated diagnostic and therapeutic treatment algorithm that arises from the current guideline's recommendations is presented in Figure 8 in the original guideline document. This treatment algorithm emphasizes the diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs). Members of the panel will be representing the guideline at their specialty societies for possible presentation and endorsement.

Because the guideline presents recommendations for an office-based diagnosis of BPPV based on positional maneuvers, an anticipated barrier to implementation is clinician unfamiliarity with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and with the supine roll test. In addition to the descriptive and diagrammatic representations of the diagnostic tests provided in the guideline, a video is available at <https://youtu.be/KLt2LtISPmQ>, illustrating performance of these maneuvers as well as representations of the expected diagnostic nystagmus findings, especially in the case of lateral canal BPPV. It will be important to incorporate guideline recommendations into the development of point-of-care decision support tools to encourage point-of-service adherence to the guidelines and to facilitate rapid clinical decision making in a busy office environment.

Another barrier to implementation of this guideline is potential clinician or patient preference for the ordering of diagnostic tests to evaluate vertigo. Because the differential diagnosis of vertigo may be vast and at times complex, clinicians may feel obligated to order diagnostic testing such as central nervous system (CNS) imaging or vestibular testing to rule out other causes of vertigo even when diagnostic criteria for BPPV are met. In addition, patients may expect imaging or additional testing based on the perception that such testing is required or a safer course of action in the routine management of vertigo. The guideline's current strong recommendation for CRP with its anticipated high, almost immediate symptom resolution rate is anticipated to decrease such expectations and tendencies. Informational pamphlets for patients regarding their diagnosis and expectations regarding the natural history of BPPV may ease this difficulty. Specialty clinicians may exhibit a tendency for ordering additional diagnostic testing due to a variety of factors. Clinician and patient education regarding outcomes expectations and counseling on proper follow-up may offset these issues.

With respect to treatment with CRP, several barriers may still need to be overcome. First, many clinicians are likely to be unfamiliar with the CRP or other treatment maneuvers. In a busy clinical setting, diagnosing physicians may be unable or unwilling to take additional time to treat BPPV at the same office visit as diagnosis. In such cases, increasing familiarity with CRP or additional training of clinicians such as audiologists, physical therapists, and other providers may facilitate patients' access to CRP. Training courses on performance of the CRP offered at clinical education meetings will also help overcome this barrier.

Finally, patients may seek what are perceived to be simpler solutions such as medication therapy for BPPV. Given that medication therapy has not been shown effective in the treatment of BPPV, clinicians will need to educate patients that these medications offer more harm than benefit. Additional education of patients will be required in the form of handouts or brochures that inform patients of the risks associated with symptomatic BPPV, including risks for falls, recurrence of BPPV, and treatment options. Algorithms for fall assessment and home safety assessment will allow clinicians to stratify patients about these risks.

## Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest



 **Financial Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest**

Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members in the past 5 years were compiled and distributed before the first conference call and were updated at each subsequent call and in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Last, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant’s previously established "stake" in an issue.
