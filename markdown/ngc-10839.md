###  Summary of Literature Review 


####  Introduction/Background 


Head trauma is a common neurologic condition and is associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. Neuroimaging plays a critical role in the management of head trauma, from identifying patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and determining which of those injuries require immediate treatment to assisting in patient prognosis. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is commonly used to stratify the severity of TBI into mild (GCS score of 13–15), moderate (GCS score of 9–12), and severe (GCS score of 3–8). Head trauma in the pediatric patient is addressed in the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) summary of the [ ACR Appropriateness Criteria® head trauma—child ](/content.aspx?id=48288 "Guideline #10453") . 


####  Overview of Imaging Modalities 


Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most widely available neuroimaging modalities in assessing head trauma. Advanced MRI techniques are discussed further in the section on imaging of subacute and chronic TBI. CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) as well as conventional catheter angiography are addressed in the section on imaging of suspected intracranial arterial injury. CT venography (CTV) and MR venography (MRV) are addressed in the section on imaging of suspected intracranial venous injury. CT cisternography is addressed in the section on imaging of suspected post-traumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. 


The advantage of CT in evaluating the head-injured patient is its sensitivity for depicting intracranial mass effect, ventricular size and configuration, bone injuries, and acute intracranial hemorrhage regardless of location (i.e., parenchymal, subarachnoid, subdural, or epidural spaces) in a rapid and efficient manner that is widely available and compatible with other medical and life-support devices. Multiplanar reformats may add value in detecting certain intracranial hemorrhages, especially along bone surfaces that approximate the transverse plane of axial images. CT is also more sensitive than MRI in detecting bony injuries. The use of a dedicated bone algorithm, multiplanar reformats, and 3-D rendering may improve the detection of nondisplaced skull fractures. The limitation of CT is a decreased sensitivity to detect small and predominantly nonhemorrhagic lesions, such as contusion or subtle diffuse axonal injury (DAI), subtle injuries adjacent to bony surfaces, and early cerebral edema, which can be seen in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in patients with moderate or severe acute closed head injury. Potential risks of unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation warrant judicious patient selection for CT scanning as well as radiation dose management. 


MRI (including a blood-sensitive sequence such as T2*) is more sensitive than CT in detecting all stages of intracranial hemorrhage, nonhemorrhagic contusions, injuries in the posterior fossa and brainstem, and DAI. The addition of susceptibility-weighted imaging in MRI for head trauma further increases the sensitivity for detection of microhemorrhages and hemorrhagic axonal injury. Limitations of MRI lie in its longer acquisition time, relatively circumscribed availability, and potential incompatibility with certain medical devices. 


The use of intravenous contrast offers no significant advantage in nonvascular neuroimaging for head trauma and is generally not indicated. 


Skull radiography has been supplanted by CT in characterizing skull fractures in the setting of acute TBI, though it may be useful in limited circumstances, such as radiopaque foreign bodies. 


####  Discussion of Imaging Modalities by Variant 


#####  Variant 1: Minor or Mild Acute Closed Head Injury (GCS ≥13), Imaging Not Indicated by New Orleans Criteria (NOC) or Canadian CT Head Rules (CCHR) or National Emergency X-Ray Utilization Study (NEXUS-II) Clinical Criteria (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document). Initial Study 


#####  Variant 2: Minor or Mild Acute Closed Head Injury (GCS ≥13), Imaging Indicated by NOC or CCHR or NEXUS-II Clinical Criteria (see Appendix 1 in the original guideline document). Initial Study 


One of the challenges facing physicians is determining which patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury can safely avoid noncontrast head CT. The NOC, CCHR, and NEXUS-II are clinical guidelines with a high sensitivity for identifying patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury who can safely avoid noncontrast head CT. All guidelines have a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for the detection of significant findings in head-injured patients. The guidelines proposed by each of these studies are listed in Appendix 1 in the original guideline document. 


Although noncontrast head CT is normal in the majority of patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury, it remains the primary modality for detecting clinically relevant brain injuries in this patient population. Though noncontrast head CT has a high negative predictive value in triaging patients, this does not mean that a patient with a negative head CT does not have TBI, and neurologically abnormal patients should be followed closely despite a negative head CT. 


MRI is not indicated as the initial imaging modality in the setting of minor or mild acute closed head injury. However, it may have a role in follow-up imaging (see Variants 4 and 5 below). 


#####  Variant 3: Moderate or Severe Acute Closed Head Injury (GCS <13). Initial Study 


For patients with moderate or severe acute closed head injury, noncontrast CT is the recommended initial imaging study. 


MRI is not indicated as the initial imaging modality in the setting of moderate to severe acute closed head injury. However, it may have a role in follow-up imaging (see Variants 4 and 5). 


#####  Variant 4: Short-term Follow-up Imaging of Acute Traumatic Brain Injury. No Neurologic Deterioration 


#####  Variant 5: Short-term Follow-up Imaging of Acute Traumatic Brain Injury. Neurologic Deterioration, Delayed Recovery, or Persistent Unexplained Deficits 


Follow-up noncontrast head CT is the recommended imaging modality in trauma patients with acute neurologic deterioration. The value of repeat noncontrast head CT in patients with a negative initial head CT and a stable neurologic examination is low. The value of repeat noncontrast head CT in patients with an abnormal initial head CT and a stable neurologic examination is also low, unless the patient has subfrontal/temporal intraparenchymal contusions, is anticoagulated, is >65 years of age, or has an intracranial hemorrhage with a volume of >10 mL. 


MRI is recommended if the patient has ongoing neurologic findings or progressive neurologic symptoms unexplained by CT in minor or mild acute closed head injury and moderate to severe acute closed head injury. MRI has an increased sensitivity to detect intracranial injuries such as contusions, axonal injury, or extra-axial hemorrhage that may be occult on CT. Contrast-enhanced MRI or CT may be helpful if post-traumatic infection is clinically suspected in patients with risk factors such as skull base fractures. For patients in which post-traumatic infarction is suspected from intracranial arterial injury, please see Variant 7. Although the use of MRI in patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury has not been found to change the management or disposition in the acute setting, the clinical significance of these findings in the nonemergent setting is an area of active research. In patients with moderate to severe acute closed head injury, early MRI (within 4 weeks) has shown DAI, with a negative prognosis seen in subjects with brainstem injury. 


#####  Variant 6: Subacute or Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury with New Cognitive and/or Neurologic Deficit(s) 


Chronic traumatic encephalopathy has come under increased scrutiny in the last several years and clinically represents a wide spectrum of symptoms, including cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and visual and auditory deficits. The biology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy is an area of active investigation. The purposes of imaging patients with chronic TBI are to improve identification of underlying injuries, to assist in patient prognosis, and to guide in the need for referral to a specialist. 


MRI is the principal modality for detecting subacute to chronic TBI, with its increased sensitivity to detect and characterize brain injuries, especially atrophy and microhemorrhages, and is recommended in patients with new, persistent, or increasing neurologic deficits. For example, the number, size, and location of MR abnormalities in subacute head injury have been used to predict the recovery outcome of patients in a posttraumatic vegetative state. 


Although MRI is superior to CT in detection of chronic sequelae of TBI such as microhemorrhages, head CT may suffice if the aim of imaging is to show areas of atrophy and often helps in documenting the absence of other structural abnormalities (such as an enlarging subacute to chronic subdural hematoma) that might require active intervention. 


Advanced neuroimaging techniques (single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], positron emission tomography [PET], perfusion CT and MRI, diffusion tensor imaging [DTI], functional MRI (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]) may have a role in assessing cognitive and neuropsychological disturbances as well as their evolution following head trauma. 


SPECT and PET have been studied in patients with subacute and chronic TBI. SPECT studies have revealed focal areas of hypoperfusion without a correlate on MRI or CT. Similarly, PET studies with fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) tracer have revealed areas of decreased metabolism more extensive than the abnormalities detected on CT or MRI. Finally, perfusion imaging with CT or MRI has also shown areas of decreased cerebral blood flow after trauma without an anatomic correlate on CT or MRI. There is ongoing investigation as to whether these findings might explain or predict postinjury neuropsychological and cognitive deficits not explained by anatomic abnormalities detected by MRI or CT. 


DTI is a technique that acquires and reconstructs MR images with diffusion weighting in at least 6 directions, followed by calculation of the tensor to create a model of diffusion in 3-D space. This allows for exploitation of the inherent directionally dependent diffusion in coherently oriented axonal fibers to image white-matter fiber tracts. This information can be postprocessed and displayed as diffusion anisotropy maps, color-coded fiber orientation maps, or 3-D fiber tracking. This technique has shown changes in the white matter of patients with TBI, though only some of these changes have correlated with clinical outcomes. 


fMRI has been studied in the setting of TBI using task-based methods such as work-memory paradigms but may be circumscribed in its ability to identify changes in TBI patients caused by the potential uncoupling of neural activity and cerebral blood flow by the TBI. 


MRS, an MRI technique used to form a spectrum of the different brain metabolites in a sampled volume of brain tissue, has also been examined in patients with TBI. A reduction in N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio and absolute N-acetylaspartate on MRS has been seen in several studies. 


Although these advanced imaging techniques are of particular interest in patients with mild TBI when CT and conventional MRI are negative, there is no conclusive evidence supporting their use for diagnosis or prognostication at the individual patient level at this time. 


#####  Variant 7: Suspected Intracranial Arterial Injury 


Traumatic intracranial arterial injuries such as dissection, occlusion, fistula, and pseudoaneurysm formation are diagnosed in approximately 0.1% of all patients hospitalized for trauma, though the majority of these patients come to attention because of clinical symptoms related to central nervous system ischemia. Screening for traumatic intracranial arterial injury should be considered in patients with neurologic symptoms unexplained by a diagnosed injury and blunt trauma patients with epistaxis from a suspected arterial source. Other risk factors for intracranial arterial injury include GCS ≤8, skull base fracture (particularly those that traverse the carotid canal), DAI, cervical spinal fracture (particularly those from the level of C1 to C3), and LeFort 2 or 3 facial bone fractures. Although conventional catheter angiography is considered the gold standard for detecting intracranial arterial injury, multidetector CTA has been found to have a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing vascular injury and is less invasive and more readily available. MRA also has a high sensitivity and specificity but may be less readily available. Similarly, conventional catheter angiography is generally used in patients with an inconclusive CTA or in patients undergoing endovascular intervention. Based on the current evidence, CTA or MRA (depending on the institutional preference and availability) is considered first line in imaging patients with suspected intracranial arterial injury. 


#####  Variant 8: Suspected Intracranial Venous Injury 


Traumatic dural sinus thrombosis is most commonly seen in patients with skull fractures that extend to a dural venous sinus or the jugular foramen. In a recent study, CTV depicted thrombosis in 40% of patients with skull fractures extending to a dural sinus or jugular bulb. CTV is comparable to MRV for the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis, though MRV is more sensitive when combined with MRI. Based on the current evidence, CTV or MRV (depending on the institutional preference and availability) is considered first line in imaging patients with suspected intracranial venous injury. 


#####  Variant 9: Suspected Post-traumatic Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak 


Acute closed head injury can also be associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. This occurs in 10% to 30% of skull base fractures and most often presents with rhinorrhea (80% of cases) in the setting of frontobasal fracture. However, it may present with otorrhea in the setting of temporal bone fracture. Most post-traumatic CSF leaks are acute in presentation and can be diagnosed clinically when CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea is confirmed with a beta-2 transferrin or beta trace protein assay. High-resolution noncontrast CT through the skull base (facial bones for rhinorrhea and temporal bones for otorrhea) can be used to identify the source of the leak in the acute or chronic setting and has been shown to be superior to CT cisternography and radionuclide cisternography. Patients with multiple potential sites may require CT cisternography to identify the culprit site. Radionuclide cisternography using indium (In)-111 diethylenetriaminepentacetate (DTPA) may have a role in cases with evidence of a CSF leak with negative or inconclusive noncontrast skull base CT and CT cisternography. MRI with high-resolution T2-weighted sequences may have a role if a post-traumatic cephalocele is suspected. 


####  Summary of Recommendations 


  * NOC, CCHR, and NEXUS-II studies are published guidelines with a high sensitivity for identifying patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury who can avoid neuroimaging. 
  * In patients with minor or mild acute closed head injury who require neuroimaging, noncontrast CT is the most appropriate initial imaging study. 
  * In moderate to severe acute closed head injury, noncontrast CT is the most appropriate initial imaging study. 
  * In short-term follow-up imaging of acute TBI without neurologic deterioration, noncontrast CT is the most appropriate imaging study, but only in patients with risk factors (such as subfrontal/temporal intraparenchymal contusions, anticoagulation, age >65 years, or intracranial hemorrhage with volume >10 mL). 
  * In short-term follow-up imaging of acute TBI with neurologic deterioration, delayed recovery, or persistent unexplained deficits, noncontrast CT is the most appropriate imaging study, but MRI has a complementary role when the patient has neurologic findings or symptoms not sufficiently explained by CT. In patients with suspected post-traumatic infection, contrast-enhanced MRI or CT may be helpful. 
  * In subacute to chronic TBI, noncontrast MRI is the most appropriate imaging study for detection of underlying brain injury in patients with new, persistent, or slowly progressive symptoms. In patients with rapidly evolving neurologic deficits, noncontrast CT may be the more appropriate imaging study due to its ready availability. Advanced neuroimaging techniques (SPECT, PET, perfusion CT and MRI, DTI, fMRI, and MRS) are areas of active research but are not considered routine clinical practice at this time. 
  * In suspected intracranial arterial injury, CTA or MRA (depending on the institutional preference and availability) is the most appropriate initial imaging study. Catheter angiography is typically reserved for problem solving or in preparation for intervention. 
  * In suspected intracranial venous injury, CTV or MRV (depending on the institutional preference and availability) is the most appropriate initial imaging study. 
  * In suspected post-traumatic CSF leak, high-resolution noncontrast skull base CT may be helpful to identify the source of the leak. CT or radionuclide cisternography may have a secondary role if skull base CT is inconclusive. High-resolution MRI may have a role if post-traumatic cephalocele is suspected.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The topic author assesses the literature then drafts or revises the narrative summarizing the evidence found in the literature. American College of Radiology (ACR) staff drafts an evidence table based on the analysis of the selected literature. These tables rate the study quality for each article included in the narrative.

The expert panel reviews the narrative, evidence table and the supporting literature for each of the topic-variant combinations and assigns an appropriateness rating for each procedure listed in the variant table(s). Each individual panel member assigns a rating based on his/her interpretation of the available evidence.

More information about the evidence table development process can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Evidence Table Development documents (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus (Delphi)

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Rating Appropriateness**

The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria (AC) methodology is based on the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. The appropriateness ratings for each of the procedures or treatments included in the AC topics are determined using a modified Delphi method. An initial survey is conducted to elicit each panelist's expert interpretation of the evidence, based on the available data, regarding the appropriateness of an imaging or therapeutic procedure for a specific clinical scenario. The expert panel members review the evidence presented and assess the risks or harms of doing the procedure balanced with the benefits of performing the procedure. The direct or indirect costs of a procedure are not considered as a risk or harm when determining appropriateness (additional assumptions regarding rating appropriateness can be found in the document [Rating Round Information](http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf "ACR Web site")). When the evidence for a specific topic and variant is uncertain or incomplete, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence or may be the sole source for assessing the appropriateness.

The appropriateness is represented on an ordinal scale that uses integers from 1 to 9 grouped into three categories: 1, 2, or 3 are in the category "usually not appropriate" where the harms of doing the procedure outweigh the benefits; and 7, 8, or 9 are in the category "usually appropriate" where the benefits of doing a procedure outweigh the harms or risks. The middle category, designated "may be appropriate," is represented by 4, 5, or 6 on the scale. The middle category is when the risks and benefits are equivocal or unclear, the dispersion of the individual ratings from the group median rating is too large (i.e., disagreement), the evidence is contradictory or unclear, or there are special circumstances or subpopulations which could influence the risks or benefits that are embedded in the variant.

The ratings assigned by each panel member are presented in a table displaying the frequency distribution of the ratings without identifying which members provided any particular rating. To determine the panel's recommendation, the rating category that contains the median group rating without disagreement is selected. This may be determined after either the first or second rating round. If there is disagreement after the first rating round, a conference call is scheduled to discuss the evidence and, if needed, clarify the variant or procedure description. If there is still disagreement after the second rating round, the recommendation is "may be appropriate."

This modified Delphi method enables each panelist to articulate his or her individual interpretations of the evidence or expert opinion without excessive influence from fellow panelists in a simple, standardized, and economical process. For additional information on the ratings process see the [Rating Round Information](http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/AppCriteria/RatingRoundInfo.pdf "ACR Web site") document.

Additional methodology documents, including a more detailed explanation of the complete topic development process and all ACR AC topics can be found on the [ACR Web site](http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria "ACR Web site") (see also the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Neuroimaging plays a critical role in the management of head trauma, from identifying patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and determining which of those injuries require immediate treatment to assisting in patient prognosis.

## Potential Harms



 **Relative Radiation Level**

Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging examination. The (RRLs) are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at inherently higher risk from exposure, both because of organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for pediatric examinations are lower as compared to those specified for adults. Additional information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * The American College of Radiology (ACR) Committee on Appropriateness Criteria (AC) and its expert panels have developed criteria for determining appropriate imaging examinations for diagnosis and treatment of specified medical condition(s). These criteria are intended to guide radiologists, radiation oncologists and referring physicians in making decisions regarding radiologic imaging and treatment. Generally, the complexity and severity of a patient's clinical condition should dictate the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Only those examinations generally used for evaluation of the patient's condition are ranked. Other imaging studies necessary to evaluate other co-existent diseases or other medical consequences of this condition are not considered in this document. The availability of equipment or personnel may influence the selection of appropriate imaging procedures or treatments. Imaging techniques classified as investigational by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been considered in developing these criteria; however, study of new equipment and applications should be encouraged. The ultimate decision regarding the appropriateness of any specific radiologic examination or treatment must be made by the referring physician and radiologist in light of all the circumstances presented in an individual examination. 
  * ACR seeks and encourages collaboration with other organizations on the development of the ACR AC through society representation on expert panels. Participation by representatives from collaborating societies on the expert panel does not necessarily imply individual or society endorsement of the final document.
