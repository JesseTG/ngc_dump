# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions of the quality of evidence assessment ( **I-III** ) and classification of recommendations ( **A-E, L** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


####  Predicting Preeclampsia 


  1. Women should be screened for clinical risk markers of preeclampsia from early pregnancy. ( **II-2C** ) See Table 6 in the original guideline document. 
  2. Consultation with an obstetrician or an obstetric internist, by telephone if necessary, should be considered for women with a history of previous preeclampsia or another strong clinical marker of increased preeclampsia risk, particularly multiple pregnancy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, significant proteinuria at first antenatal visit (usually early in pregnancy), or a pre-existing condition of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or renal disease. ( **II-2B** ) 
  3. Screening using biomarkers or Doppler ultrasound velocimetry of the uteroplacental circulation cannot be recommended routinely at present for women at low or increased risk of preeclampsia until such screening has been shown to improve pregnancy outcome. ( **II-2C** ) 




####  Preventing Preeclampsia and Its Complications in Women at Low Risk 


  4. Calcium supplementation of at least 1 g/d, orally, is recommended for women with low dietary intake of calcium ( <600 mg/d). ( **I-A** ) 
  5. The following are recommended for other established beneficial effects in pregnancy: abstention from alcohol for prevention of fetal alcohol effects ( **II-2E** ), exercise for maintenance of fitness ( **I-A** ), periconceptual use of a folate-containing multivitamin for prevention of neural tube defects ( **I-A** ), and smoking cessation for prevention of low birthweight and preterm birth. ( **I-E** ) 
  6. Periconceptual and ongoing use of a folate-containing multivitamin ( **I-B** ) or exercise ( **II-2B** ) may be useful in preventing preeclampsia. 
  7. Prostaglandin precursors and supplementation with magnesium or zinc are **not** recommended for preeclampsia prevention, but may be useful for prevention of other pregnancy complications. ( **I-C** ) 
  8. Dietary salt restriction during pregnancy ( **I-D** ), calorie restriction during pregnancy for overweight women ( **I-D** ), low-dose acetylsalicylic acid ( **I-E** ), vitamins C and E (based on current evidence) ( **I-E** ), and thiazide diuretics ( **I-E** ) are not recommended. 
  9. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about a heart-healthy diet ( **II-2L** ); workload or stress reduction (including bedrest) ( **II-2L** ); supplementation with iron with or without folate ( **I-L** ); vitamin D ( **I-L** ); pyridoxine ( **I-L** ); or food rich in flavonoids. ( **I-L** ) 




####  Preventing Preeclampsia and Its Complications in Women at Increased Risk 


  10. Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and calcium supplementation (of at least 1 g/d) for women with low calcium intake are recommended for preventions of preeclampsia in women at high risk. ( **I-A** ) 
  11. Acetylsalicylic acid should be: taken in a low dose (75 to 162 mg/d), ( **III-B** ) administered at bedtime, ( **I-B** ) initiated after diagnosis of pregnancy but before 16 weeks' gestation, ( **I-B** ) and considered for continuation until delivery. ( **I-C** ) 
  12. Prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin may be discussed in women with previous placental complications (including preeclampsia) to prevent the recurrence of severe or early-onset preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and/or infants that are small for gestational age. ( **I-B** ) 
  13. The following may be useful: L-arginine ( **I-B** ), increased rest at home in the third trimester ( **I-C** ), and reduction of workload or stress. ( **III-C** ) 
  14. The following may be useful for prevention of other pregnancy complications: prostaglandin precursors ( **I-B** ), magnesium supplementation ( **I-C** ), and heparin to prevent venous thromboembolic disease. ( **I-B** ) 
  15. The following are recommended for other established beneficial effects in pregnancy (as discussed for women at low risk of preeclampsia): abstention from alcohol ( **II-2E** ), periconceptual use of a folate-containing multivitamin ( **I-A** ), and smoking cessation. ( **I-E** ) 
  16. The following are **not** recommended: calorie restriction in overweight women during pregnancy ( **I-D** ), weight maintenance in obese women during pregnancy ( **III-D** ), antihypertensive therapy specifically to prevent preeclampsia ( **I-D** ), and vitamins C and E. ( **I-E** ) 
  17. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the usefulness of the following: the heart-healthy diet ( **III-L** ); exercise ( **I-L** ); selenium ( **I-L** ); garlic ( **I-L** ); zinc, pyridoxine, iron (with or without folate), vitamin D, or multivitamins with/without micronutrients. ( **III-L** ) 




###  Definitions: 


**Quality of Evidence Assessment** * 


**I** : Evidence obtained from at least one properly randomized controlled trial 


**II-1** : Evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization 


**II-2** : Evidence from well-designed cohort (prospective or retrospective) or case–control studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group 


**II-3** : Evidence obtained from comparisons between times or places with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments (such as the results of treatment with penicillin in the 1940s) could also be included in this category 


**III** : Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees 


*Adapted from The Evaluation of Evidence criteria described in the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. 


####  Classification of Recommendations† 


**A** . There is good evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action 


**B** . There is fair evidence to recommend the clinical preventive action 


**C** . The existing evidence is conflicting and does not allow to make a recommendation for or against use of the clinical preventive action; however, other factors may influence decision-making 


**D** . There is fair evidence to recommend against the clinical preventive action 


**E** . There is good evidence to recommend against the clinical preventive action 


**L** . There is insufficient evidence (in quantity or quality) to make a recommendation; however, other factors may influence decision-making

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases
- Searches of Unpublished Data

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



Published literature was retrieved through searches of MEDLINE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and The Cochrane Library in March 2012 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., pregnancy, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy toxemias) and key words (e.g., diagnosis, evaluation, classification, prediction, prevention, prognosis, treatment, postpartum follow-up). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials, controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in French or English between January 2006 and February 2012. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to September 2013. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



The Appendix (see Table 10 in the full version of the original guideline document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]) lists tools to support the application of this guideline. Some Web sites provide general information about blood pressure (BP) measurement for non-pregnant patients, but the recommendations are similar enough to those for pregnant women to be useful. Patients, their partners, and their care providers should be well educated about the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and relevant sites are listed.

Implementation of any evidence depends on individual knowledge and beliefs, as well as institutional culture. Strong recommendations should be incorporated into clinical practice. In well-resourced settings, almost all preeclampsia-related maternal deaths involve substandard care.

Some updates to the 2008 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines on the HDP may require additional effort to implement.

Physicians should consider the category "other HDP" (white-coat and masked hypertension) as part of the classification of hypertensive women and consider using some form of out-of-office BP measurement to evaluate women with non-severe pre-existing or gestational hypertension.

Health care providers should inform pregnant women about the symptoms and signs of the HDPs and refer them to appropriate knowledge translation tools.

The developer recommends the use of corticosteroids for women ≤ 34+6 weeks' gestation who are at high risk of delivery within the next seven days. This gestational age cut-off represents a fundamental change in practice that will require discussion.

Physicians should be familiar with the blood bank policies of their own hospital.

Physicians should be aware of postpartum signs of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and the maternal and perinatal long-term effects of HDPs, especially at this vulnerable time in maternal care when the maternity care provider is often handing back care to the primary care physician.

The reader is reminded to refer to the full open-access guideline published in Pregnancy Hypertension, which contains not only the recommendations presented here, but also all explanatory text and additional references.
