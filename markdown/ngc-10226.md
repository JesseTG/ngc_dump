#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management, but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical drugs 
  * Benefit: Effective therapy, low incidence of adverse events 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Direct cost of medication (varies greatly depending on drug class and selection), risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics 
  * Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: randomized controlled trial results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited 
  * Intentional vagueness: No specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent 
  * Role of patient preferences: Substantial role for patient preference in choice of topical therapeutic agent 
  * Exceptions: Patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane (see Statement 7 below on "Nonintact Tympanic Membrane") 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 6. Drug Delivery 


The clinician should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies and D, first principles 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: High 
  * Benefit: Improved adherence to therapy and drug delivery 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Pain and local trauma caused by inappropriate aural toilet or wick insertion; direct cost of wick (inexpensive) 
  * Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm

  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: Choice of self-administering drops versus using assistant 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 7. Nonintact Tympanic Membrane 


When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a non-ototoxic topical preparation. 


#####  Recommendation based on reasoning from first principles and on exceptional circumstances in which validating studies cannot be performed and there is a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate, because of extrapolation of data from animal studies and little direct evidence in patients with AOE 
  * Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance 
  * Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly 
  * Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm

  * Intentional vagueness: None 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None 




####  Statement 8. Outcome Assessment 


The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. 


#####  Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. 


#####  Action Statement Profile 


  * Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, outcomes from individual treatment arms of randomized controlled trials of efficacy of topical therapy for AOE 
  * Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, because most randomized trials have been conducted in specialist settings and the generalizability to primary care settings is unknown 
  * Benefit: Identify misdiagnosis and potential complications from delayed management; reduce pain 
  * Risks, harms, costs: Cost of reevaluation by clinician 
  * Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm 
  * Value judgments: None 
  * Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement 
  * Role of patient preferences: None 
  * Exceptions: None 
  * Policy level: Recommendation 
  * Differences of opinion: None

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The original MEDLINE search was updated from July 2005 to October 2012 on PubMed using "otitis externa" (Medical Subject Headings [MeSH] term) and "swimmer's ear." The English-language search, which was supplemented by manual cross-checks of bibliographies from systematic reviews, identified 6 clinical practice guidelines, 4 systematic reviews, and 52 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). After assessing quality and relevance, the guideline developers retained none of the guidelines, 2 of the systematic reviews, and 12 RCTs.

## Number of Source Documents



  * 2 systematic reviews 
  * 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined. Evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the statement is followed. The definitions for evidence-based statements are listed the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" and the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" fields. As much of the guideline dealt with evidence relating to diagnostic tests, the definitions for Evidence Quality for Grades of Evidence (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) was adapted to include current recommendations from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



In developing this update of the evidence-based clinical practice guideline on managing acute otitis externa (AOE), the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) assembled a working group representing the disciplines of otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, pediatrics, infectious disease, family medicine, dermatology, and a consumer advocate. The panel followed the methodology for updating guidelines detailed in the AAO-HNSF's guideline development manual.

A systematic review had been conducted to support initial guideline development, but an update was deemed unnecessary because of only limited new evidence that was incorporated into the newer systematic reviews identified. An executive summary of the existing guideline was then sent to a panel of reviewers. They were asked to assess the statements in the original guideline and recommend if they should be kept as is, amended, or removed based on relevancy, omissions, or controversies that the guideline spurred and any new literature or treatments that might affect the guideline recommendations.

The working group then had one conference call and one face-to-face meeting during which these comments and the literature search were reviewed for each action statement. The panel then decided to leave the statement unaltered, change slightly, or rewrite the statement based on the impact of the literature search and the reviewer's comments. The supporting text was then edited to explain any changes from the original action statement and recommendation level.

The evidence profile for each statement was then converted into an action statement profile, which was moved up in the text to immediately follow the action statement. Statements about the level of confidence in the evidence, any intentional vagueness included in the action statement, and any exclusions to whom the action statement does not apply were added to the action statement profile. These additions reflect the current methodology for guideline development by the AAO-HNSF and conform to the Institute of Medicine's standards for developing trustworthy guidelines.

The updated guideline then underwent Guideline Implementability Appraisal, to appraise adherence to methodologic standards, to improve the clarity of recommendations, and to predict potential obstacles to implementation.

## Cost Analysis



A formal cost analysis was not performed and published cost analyses were not reviewed.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



The final draft practice guideline underwent extensive external peer review. Comments were compiled and reviewed by the group chairperson.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The recommendations contained in the guideline are based on the best available published data through October 2012. Where data were lacking, a combination of clinical experience and expert consensus was used.

The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, the guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease inappropriate variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve outcomes and satisfaction for affected patients.

For benefits of specific interventions considered in the guideline, see the "Major Recommendations" field.

## Potential Harms



  * Adverse effects of analgesics for pain relief 
  * Risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics 
  * Pain and local trauma caused by inappropriate aural toilet or wick insertion 
  * Only a few studies on topical antimicrobial and steroid preparations report detailed information on adverse events, showing an overall low incidence and comparable rates among treatment groups. The most common problems are pruritus (about 5% to 7%) and site reaction (4% to 5%); other events with an incidence less than 2% include rash, discomfort, otalgia, dizziness, vertigo, superinfection, and reduced hearing. 
  * Contact dermatitis is a potential sequela of topical antimicrobial or steroid therapy but is rare after a single course of therapy for diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE). 
  * Orally administered antibiotics have significant adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance. Societal consequences include direct transmission of resistant bacterial pathogens in homes and child care centers. 



# Contraindications

## Contraindications



Topical antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in managing otomycosis because it is ineffective and may promote further fungal overgrowth.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



  * Guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance. Less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" than might be expected with a "recommendation." "Options" offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. They must also operate within their scope of practice and according to their training. Guidelines represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic. 
  * Making recommendations about health practices involves value judgments on the desirability of various outcomes associated with management options. Values applied by the guideline panel sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy. A major goal of the panel was to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process. 
  * This clinical practice guideline is provided for information and education purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing patients with acute otitis externa (AOE). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. This guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosis and management. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions, but they are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates; these do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in light of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper treatment decisions or methods of care nor exclusive of other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. 



# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



**Implementation Considerations**

The complete guideline is published as a supplement to _Otolaryngology —Head and Neck Surgery_ to facilitate reference and distribution. A full-text version of the guideline will also be accessible free of charge at the [www.entnet.org](http://www.entnet.org "AAO-HNSF Web site"), the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) Web site. A podcast discussing the updated guideline and its key action statements will also be made available. The guideline will be presented to members at AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting & OTO EXPO as a miniseminar following publication. Existing brochures and publications by the AAO-HNSF will be updated to reflect the guideline recommendations.

Anticipated barriers to applying the recommendations in the guideline include (1) difficulty of changing ingrained clinician habits toward prescribing ineffective systemic therapy for acute otitis externa (AOE), (2) inability or unwillingness of some clinicians to perform aural toilet or insert a wick into the ear canal, and (3) cost of some topical medications, especially the quinolone products recommended for use with a nonintact tympanic membrane. The first two can be addressed with educational events and workshops at continuing medical education events. The issue of cost should become less problematic in the next few years as additional generic versions of the quinolone otic drops become available. For example, subsequent to the first publication of this guideline in 2006, a generic version of ofloxacin otic solution has become available at reasonable cost.

The impact of the guideline on clinical practice will be assessed by monitoring physician performance on the AOE quality measures included within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS). The AOE quality measures were developed by the American Medical Association's convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) in conjunction with the AAO-HNSF; two are available for PQRS reporting in 2013. The two measures assess the prescribing of systemic and topical antimicrobials. In addition, the AAO-HNSF will continue to promote adherence to the guideline's recommendations through its quality improvement activities. This includes participation in the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation's Choosing Wisely® campaign. The AAO-HNSF's first list of 5 things physicians and patients should question included an item to not prescribe systemic antimicrobials for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE (see Statement 4 in the "Major Recommendations" field).

## Financial Disclosures/Conflicts of Interest



 **Financial Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest**

The cost of updating this guideline, including travel expenses of all panel members, was covered in full by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). Potential conflicts of interest for all panel members were compiled and distributed before the first in-person meeting. After review and discussion of these disclosures, the panel concluded that individuals with potential conflicts could remain on the panel if they (1) reminded the panel of potential conflicts before any related discussion, (2) recused themselves from a related discussion if asked by the panel, and (3) agreed not to discuss any aspect of the guideline with industry before publication. Lastly, panelists were reminded that conflicts of interest extend beyond financial relationships and may include personal experiences, how a participant earns a living, and the participant's previously established "stake" in an issue.
