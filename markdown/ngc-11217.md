# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Review**

The literature review began with an environmental scan of existing guidelines and guidance developed by other organizations (e.g., the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® [NCCN®], ASCO), specific medical centers (e.g., The University of Texas MD Anderson Clinical Tools and Resources Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship algorithm, US Preventive Services Task Force), and those available from other countries (e.g., Australian Cancer Survivorship Centre).

**Literature Search Strategy**

A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed for 2004 through April 2015. Studies on childhood cancers, qualitative studies, and non-English publications were excluded. Also excluded were studies that consisted of entirely non-North American populations, because head and neck cancer (HNC) prevalence is higher in some countries due to lifestyle causes and differing etiology. Search terms included: cancer survivor AND review OR meta-analysis OR systematic review OR guidelines; guidance AND head and neck cancer OR head and neck cancer survivor; head and neck cancer patient post-treatment AND symptom management OR late effects OR long-term effects OR psychosocial care OR palliative care OR health promotion OR surveillance OR screening for new cancers OR self-management OR guidelines OR guidance OR follow up OR follow-up OR side effects OR (chemotherapy AND side effects) OR (radiation AND side effects), OR surgery OR treatment complications OR genetic counseling and testing OR survivor or patient interventions OR provider interventions OR provider education OR barriers. Additional search attempts included head and neck cancer OR head and neck cancer survivor OR head and neck cancer patient post-treatment AND (symptom-specific terms, such as swallowing, body image, neck dissection, etc.).

The highest priority was given to articles that met the following criteria: peer-reviewed publication in English since 2004 unless a seminal article published before that date still carried the most weight, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and population-based case-control studies; studies of more than 50 cancer cases analyzed and with high-quality assessment of covariates and analytic methods; and analyses controlled for important confounders (e.g., preexisting comorbid conditions).

## Number of Source Documents



Of the total number of 2,081 articles identified by the search, 349 met inclusion criteria; and, after full text review, 184 were included as the evidence base.

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



Workgroup members were asked to consider the specific level of evidence (LOE) criteria (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field) along with consistency across studies and study designs; dose-response when presenting treatment impacts; race/ethnicity differences; and second primary cancers (SPCs) for which survivors are at high risk because of treatment and behavioral considerations.

The guideline summarizes literature with the highest level of evidence. A comprehensive list of evidence is available in the Supporting Information Table (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Methods**

Methods used to develop this guideline were influenced by the American Cancer Society (ACS) cancer screening and survivorship care guidelines. Where appropriate, this guideline builds upon the recently published American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) symptom-based guidelines for adult cancer survivors. ASCO has symptom-based guidelines specific to fatigue, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and anxiety and depressive symptoms.

**Panel Formation**

A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was formed and tasked with drafting the ACS Head and Neck Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. Workgroup members had expertise in primary care, dentistry, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, clinical psychology, speech language pathology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and nursing. In addition, a head and neck cancer (HNC) cancer survivor was included to provide a patient perspective.

**Results**

Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Clinical interpretation of the included evidence follows each recommendation, along with a rating of the level of evidence (LOE) supporting each recommendation. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature, but most evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong, evidence-based recommendation. Rather, recommendations should be largely viewed as possible management strategies given the current evidence base and the logistical challenges of comprehensively adhering to these recommendations.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

Less than 2% of eligible articles were rated as level I evidence, less than 4% were rated as level IA evidence, less than 1% were rated as level IC evidence, and less than 3% were rated as level IIA evidence. The majority of evidence was rated as level III (28%) and level 0 (64%). Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion.

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Appropriate management of head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors to provide high-quality, comprehensive, coordinated clinical follow-up that addresses each patient's individual risk profile and preferences of care to address physical and psychosocial effects from HNC and its treatment

Refer to the "Clinical Interpretation" sections of the original guideline document for a detailed discussion of the potential benefits of each recommendation.

## Potential Harms



  * Potential harms from low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, such as death related to interventions in benign nodules, or deaths related to follow-up procedures, such as bronchoscopy and needle biopsy within 2 months of the screening (3.4% per 10,000 screened by LDCT and 2.2 per 10,000 screened by chest x-ray [CXR]) 
  * Primary care clinicians should be aware that oral antibiotics for unrelated, systemic infections increase the likelihood of fungal overgrowth and infection in the oral cavity. 
  * Compression garments used for treatment of lymphedema can be poorly tolerated, and customization may be required for routine use.

 **Guideline Disclaimer**

The clinical practice guideline published herein is provided by the American Cancer Society (ACS) to assist providers in clinical decision making. This information should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases.

This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Furthermore, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. The ACS provides this information on an "as is" basis and makes no warranty, express or suggested, regarding the information. The ACS specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. The ACS assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of this information, or for any errors or omissions.

**Limitations**

A significant limitation of this guideline is the limited evidence base to provide clear and specific recommendations for the prevention and management of long-term and late effects of cancer survivors. There are few prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing interventions among head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. The majority of the citations characterizing the risk and magnitude of risk of late effects and management recommendations rely predominantly on case-control studies with fewer than 500 participants and reviews that combine studies with various outcome measures. There were several cohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of late effects.

Refer to the "Limitations" section of the original guideline document for additional information.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ACS health systems network. The ACS guidelines are posted on the ACS Web site at [cancer.org/professionals](https://www.cancer.org/professionals "ACS Web site").

**More Resources**

In addition to this guideline, tools and resources are available to assist primary care clinicians in implementing these recommendations. _CA_ offers a Patient Page ([onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.3322/caac.21344/](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.3322/caac.21344/ "CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians Web site")) to help patients understand how to use this guideline to talk to the primary care clinician about surveillance and screening, symptom management, healthy behaviors, and care coordination. _CA_ also offers free continuing medical education and free continuing nursing education for this article at [acsjournals.com/ce](http://www.acsjournals.com/ce "CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians Web site") as an additional resource for physicians and nurses. The Survivorship Center also offers The George Washington University Cancer Institute's Cancer Survivorship E-Learning Series for Primary Care Providers (The E-Learning Series), a free, innovative, online, continuing-education program to educate primary care clinicians about how to better understand and care for survivors in the primary care setting. Continuing education credits are available at no cost to physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and physician assistants for each 1-hour module.
