# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



Definitions for the rating of evidence ( **High** , **Intermediate** , **Low** , **Insufficient** ); types of recommendations ( **Evidence based** , **Formal consensus** , **Informal consensus** , **No recommendation** ); and strength of recommendations ( **Strong** , **Moderate** , **Weak** ) are provided at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Clinical Question 1 


####  What clinical evaluations should be performed in all women with suspected or newly diagnosed stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer? 


#####  Recommendation 1.1: All women with suspected stage IIIC or IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist prior to initiation of therapy to determine whether they are candidates for primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS). (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong.) 


#####  Recommendation 1.2: A primary clinical evaluation should include a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast and chest imaging (CT preferred) to evaluate the extent of disease and the feasibility of surgical resection. The use of other tools to refine this assessment may include laparoscopic evaluation or additional radiographic imaging (e.g., [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography [FDG-PET] scan or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). (Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 2 


####  Which patient and disease factors should be used as criteria for identifying patients who are not suitable for PCS? 


#####  Recommendation 2.1: Women who have a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to <1 cm (ideally to no visible disease) should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


#####  Recommendation 2.2: Decisions that women are not eligible for medical or surgical cancer treatment should be made after a consultation with a gynecologic oncologist and/or a medical oncologist with gynecologic expertise. (Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 3 


####  How do NACT and PCS compare with respect to progression-free survival, overall survival, and perioperative morbidity and mortality in women with newly diagnosed stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer who are fit for primary cytoreduction and have potentially resectable disease, and how should this information be used to select initial treatment? 


#####  Recommendation 3.1: For women who are fit for PCS, with potentially resectable disease, either NACT or PCS may be offered based on data from phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrate that NACT is noninferior to PCS with respect to progression-free and overall survival. NACT is associated with less peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality and shorter hospitalizations, but PCS may offer superior survival in selected patients. (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


#####  Recommendation 3.2: For women with a high likelihood of achieving a cytoreduction to <1 cm (ideally to no visible disease) with acceptable morbidity, PCS is recommended over NACT. (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


#####  Recommendation 3.3: For women who are fit for PCS but are deemed unlikely to have cytoreduction to <1 cm (ideally to no visible disease) by a gynecologic oncologist, NACT is recommended over PCS. NACT is associated with less peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality and shorter hospitalizations. (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 4 


####  What additional clinical evaluations should be performed in all women with suspected or newly diagnosed stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer before NACT is delivered? 


#####  Recommendation 4: Before NACT is delivered, all patients should have histologic confirmation (core biopsy preferred) of an invasive ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. In exceptional cases, when a biopsy cannot be performed, cytologic evaluation combined with a serum cancer antigen (CA)-125 to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ratio >25 is acceptable to confirm the primary diagnosis and exclude cancers that are not ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinomas (Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 5 


####  What is the preferred chemotherapy regimen for women with stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer who will receive NACT? 


#####  Recommendation 5 


For NACT, a platinum/taxane doublet is recommended. However, alternate regimens, containing a platinum agent, may be selected based on individual patient factors. (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate.) 


###  Clinical Question 6 


####  Among women treated with NACT, does the timing of interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS) or the number of chemotherapy cycles after ICS affect the safety or efficacy of treatment? 


#####  Recommendation 6 


RCTs tested surgery following three or four cycles of chemotherapy in women who had a response to NACT or stable disease. ICS should be performed after â‰¤4 cycles of NACT for women with a response to chemotherapy or stable disease. Alternate timing of surgery has not been prospectively evaluated but may be considered based on patient-centered factors. (Type: informal consensus; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak.) 


###  Clinical Question 7 


####  What are the treatment options for patients with progressive disease on NACT? 


#####  Recommendation 7 


Patients with progressive disease on NACT have a poor prognosis. Options include alternative chemotherapy regimens, clinical trials, and/or discontinuation of active cancer therapy and initiation of end-of-life care. In general, there is little role for surgery and it is not typically advised, unless for palliation (e.g., relief of a bowel obstruction). (Type: evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong.)

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases
- Searches of Unpublished Data

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search Strategy**

PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration Library electronic databases, and meeting abstracts from American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), or the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) were searched for evidence reporting on outcomes of interest. Further details on the search strategy and results are provided in Data Supplements 3 and 4 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

**Guideline Development Process**

Panelists considered evidence from a systematic review of phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and multicenter cohort studies published between March 20, 2005, and March 20, 2015. A list of search terms is provided in the Data Supplement (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field). Meeting abstracts were included if they provided results from still-unpublished RCTs and were presented at meetings of ASCO, SGO, or ESMO from 2010 to 2015.

Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence based on the following criteria:

  * Population: Women with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. 
  * Study type: Evidence regarding the outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was drawn from published or presented phase III RCTs. Evidence regarding predictive and prognostic factors in advanced ovarian cancer was drawn from RCTs, multicenter cohort studies, meta-analyses, and population-based observational data. Inclusion of influential single center cohort studies was made at the discretion of the panel. 



Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews, or published in a non-English language.

## Number of Source Documents



Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met eligibility criteria and form the primary evidence base for the guideline recommendations.

Information about prognostic and predictive factors in ovarian cancer was collected from nine multicenter or population-based cohort studies, three single-center cohort studies, and one meta-analysis.

A Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) Diagram that reports the results of the literature search is available in Data Supplement 4 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Data Extraction**

Literature search results were reviewed and deemed appropriate for full text review by one American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) staff reviewer in consultation with the Expert Panel Co-Chairs. Data were extracted by one staff reviewer and subsequently checked for accuracy through an audit of the data by another ASCO staff member. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and consultation with the Co-Chairs if necessary. Evidence tables are provided in the original guideline document and in Data Supplements 1 and 2 (see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field).

**Study Quality Assessment**

Study quality was formally assessed for the studies identified. Design aspects related to the individual study quality were assessed by one reviewer and included factors such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control, intention to treat, funding sources, etc. The risk of bias is assessed as "low," "intermediate," or "high" for most of the identified evidence.

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus
- Informal Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Panel Composition**

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC), in collaboration with the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), convened an Expert Panel with multidisciplinary representation in medical oncology, gynecologic oncology, community oncology, patient/advocacy representation, and guideline implementation. The Expert Panel was led by two Co-Chairs who had primary responsibility for the development and timely completion of the guideline. For this guideline product, the Co-Chairs selected additional members from the Expert Panel to form a Writing Group to assist in the development and review of the guideline drafts.

**Guideline Development Process**

The Expert Panel met four times and corresponded frequently through e-mail; progress on guideline development was driven primarily by the Co-Chairs along with ASCO and SGO staff. The purpose of the meetings was for members to contribute content, provide critical review, interpret evidence, and finalize the guideline recommendations based upon the consideration of the evidence. All members of the Expert Panel participated in the preparation of the draft guideline document.

**Development of Recommendations**

The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the GuideLines Into DEcision Support (GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz softwareâ„¢. This method helps guideline panels systematically develop clear, translatable, and implementable recommendations using natural language, based on the evidence and assessment of its quality to increase usability for end users. The process incorporates distilling the actions involved, identifying who will carry them out, to whom, under what circumstances, and clarifying if and how end users can carry out the actions consistently. This process helps the Panel focus the discussion, avoid using unnecessary and/or ambiguous language, and clearly state its intentions.

## Cost Analysis



**Cost Implications**

Decisions between primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) should be driven by the expected clinical risks and benefits rather than by cost. Nevertheless, cost may warrant consideration when the two treatment options appear similarly beneficial, or when cost is an important concern for the patient. The comparative cost of PCS and NACT has been evaluated using observational data from SEER-Medicare. Among 4,506 older women with advanced ovarian cancer, the costs associated with PCS and NACT were similar for women with stage IIIC disease, but PCS was associated with higher costs in women with stage IV disease. The cost of care among older women (age â‰¥65 years) with advanced ovarian cancer has also been evaluated using a 5-year Markov model, which assumed similar overall survival with PCS and NACT based upon the results of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971. In this study, NACT was associated with a cost savings of $5,616 compared with PCS, when costs included surgery, chemotherapy, and hospital stays. To date, researchers have not included quality-adjusted life-years in comparisons of the costs between PCS and NACT. Given the limitations of current data, the relative costs of the two treatment approaches remain uncertain.

## Method of Guideline Validation

Patients who develop progressive disease during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) should avoid interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS) unless they have a demonstrated response to an alternate chemotherapy. It is very unlikely that an optimal surgical cytoreduction can be achieved in patients with primary platinum-refractory disease, and the survival benefit of a potentially morbid surgery is uncertain in this context.

  * The Clinical Practice Guidelines and other guidance published herein are provided by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc. (ASCO) to assist providers in clinical decision making. The information herein should not be relied upon as being complete or accurate, nor should it be considered as inclusive of all proper treatments or methods of care or as a statement of the standard of care. With the rapid development of scientific knowledge, new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read. The information is not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. The information addresses only the topics specifically identified therein and is not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases. This information does not mandate any particular course of medical care. Further, the information is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating provider, as the information does not account for individual variation among patients. Recommendations reflect high, moderate, or low confidence that the recommendation reflects the net effect of a given course of action. The use of words like "must," "must not," "should," and "should not" indicates that a course of action is recommended or not recommended for either most or many patients, but there is latitude for the treating physician to select other courses of action in individual cases. In all cases, the selected course of action should be considered by the treating provider in the context of treating the individual patient. Use of the information is voluntary. ASCO provides this information on an "as is" basis and makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the information. ASCO specifically disclaims any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose.

# Implementation of the Guideline

## Description of Implementation Strategy



**Guideline Implementation**

American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line practitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers, and to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementation Network. ASCO guidelines are posted on the [ASCO Web site](https://www.asco.org/practice-guidelines/quality-guidelines/implementation-strategy "ASCO Web site") and most often published in the _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ and the _Journal of Oncology Practice_.

For additional information on the ASCO implementation strategy, please see the [ASCO Web site](https://www.asco.org/practice-guidelines/quality-guidelines/implementation-strategy "ASCO Web site").
