# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The evidence search and review included electronic database searches in _The Cochrane Library_ , Medline via Ovid, and CINAHL via EBSCO. The search strategy is shown in the Appendix in the original guideline document. Related article searches were conducted in PubMed. The bibliographies of articles identified by database searches were also reviewed by 1 of 4 members of the committee, and references identified in this manner were added to the review. Articles included in the 2003 evidence report on bronchiolitis in preparation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2006 guideline also were reviewed. In addition, the committee reviewed articles published after completion of the systematic review for these updated guidelines. The current literature review encompasses the period from 2004 through May 2014.

Other criteria helped define the setting, age, language, and date of publication. Both outpatient (clinicians' offices, outpatient clinics, emergency departments) and inpatient (hospitals) were included. Studies were limited to pediatrics. Searches were also limited to English language, although studies in other languages were reviewed when included in relevant systematic reviews. Date parameters were not restricted; however, newer studies were focused for antimicrobial therapy and cost effectiveness studies. In addition to the electronic searches, articles were received from subcommittee members, and reference lists were also searched. The same criteria were applied to these articles as to those in the initial search.

Study design criteria for full text review varied by section of the technical report. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews were reviewed for original studies not found in the initial electronic searches. For diagnostic studies, controlled clinical trials and observational studies (both prospective and large retrospective) studies were reviewed. For therapy studies, randomized controlled trials were reviewed as well as large prospective and retrospective observational studies. For prevention and long term effect studies, prospective observational and other epidemiologic studies were reviewed.

## Number of Source Documents



From the initial electronic search, 2,887 articles were found related to infants and children diagnosed with bronchiolitis and its management. After removing duplicate citations and title and abstract review for relevance, patient population, and study design, full text review of 418 articles also included appraisal of validity. Committee members submitted an additional 46 articles. Seventeen articles were found through searching reference lists. Of these articles, 146 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the technical report.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Study Selection and Evaluation**

Titles and abstracts were reviewed by a methodologist for potential inclusion. Titles and abstracts not relevant to the clinical topic areas designated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Bronchiolitis Management Guideline Committee were excluded. Full texts of articles related to the respective sections of the guideline were distributed to committee members for review. The methodologist also reviewed all full text articles for the technical report, critically appraising individual articles using the Let Evidence Guide Every New Decision (LEGEND) evidence evaluation system. Evidence quality appraisal for the body of evidence related to recommendation statements followed the AAP's levels for aggregate evidence quality, allowing for integration of evidence into the recommendation development process by committee members. Narrative evidence synthesis was conducted and data was extracted by the methodologist. Evidence tables were constructed to summarize the studies, when relevant.

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Methods**

In June 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a new subcommittee to review and revise the 2006 bronchiolitis guideline. The subcommittee included primary care physicians, including general pediatricians, a family physician, and pediatric subspecialists, including hospitalists, pulmonologists, emergency physicians, a neonatologist, and pediatric infectious disease physicians. The subcommittee also included an epidemiologist trained in systematic reviews, a guideline methodologist/informatician, and a parent representative.

The evidence-based approach to guideline development requires that the evidence in support of a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and recommendations be defined. Evidence-based recommendations reflect the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm that is anticipated when the recommendation is followed. The AAP policy statement "Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice" was followed in designating levels of recommendation (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations" field).

**Strong recommendation**
</td>  
<td>

A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable.

**Weak recommendation** (based on low-quality evidence)
</td>  
<td>

A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak.

## Method of Guideline Validation

- External Peer Review
- Internal Peer Review

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



A draft version of this clinical practice guideline underwent extensive peer review by committees, councils, and sections within American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); the American Thoracic Society, American College of Chest Physicians, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American College of Emergency Physicians; other outside organizations; and other individuals identified by the subcommittee as experts in the field. The resulting comments were reviewed by the subcommittee and, when appropriate, incorporated into the guideline.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for each recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



See the "Major Recommendations" field for benefits of specific interventions considered in the guideline.

## Potential Harms



  * Adverse effects from nebulized hypertonic saline, such as wheezing and excess secretions 
  * The risk of hypoxemia must be weighed against the risk of hospitalization when making any decisions about site of care. One study of hospitalized children with bronchiolitis, for example, noted a 10% adverse error or near-miss rate for harm-causing interventions. 
  * Side effects from palivizumab 
  * See the "Major Recommendations" field for more information on possible harms of specific interventions. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with bronchiolitis. Rather, it is intended to assist clinicians in decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with bronchiolitis. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with bronchiolitis. 
  * The recommendations in this report do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.
