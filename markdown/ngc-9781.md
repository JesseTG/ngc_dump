# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



The strength of the recommendation (strongly recommended, recommended, or no recommendation) and the quality of the evidence (1a‒5b) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


It is recommended that cuff pressure be measured in the neonatal and pediatric population. 


**Note 1** : There are no studies that compare any one of these measurement approaches to another in neonates and pediatrics therefore one approach over another cannot be recommended. Research among the neonatal and pediatric populations would prove beneficial. 


**Note 2** : At Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), current policy is to utilize minimal occlusive volume (MOV) and measure pressures with a cuff manometer, at least once per shift.

  1. Tracheal cuff pressure measurement (cuff manometer) 
  2. Minimal leak technique (MLT)/minimal occlusive volume (MOV) technique 



## Major Outcomes Considered



Effectiveness of measuring cuff pressures

If cuff is over distended tracheal damage can occur and if cuff is underinflated inadequate ventilation can occur and/or aspiration.

# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements



This Best Evidence Statement addresses only key points of care for the target population; it is not intended to be a comprehensive practice guideline. These recommendations result from review of literature and practices current at the time of their formulation. This Best Evidence Statement does not preclude using care modalities proven efficacious in studies published subsequent to the current revision of this document. This document is not intended to impose standards of care preventing selective variances from the recommendations to meet the specific and unique requirements of individual patients.
