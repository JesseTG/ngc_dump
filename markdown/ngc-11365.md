####  Strength of Recommendations 


**A** –There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm. 


**B** –There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. 


**C** –There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. 


**I** –There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined. 


**D** –It is recommended that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits. 


**Note** : Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2012). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using it.

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Secondary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The following three focused questions, from the review of occupational therapy interventions for people with musculoskeletal disorders, framed the reviews: 

  1. What is the evidence for the effect of occupational therapy interventions for adults with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand)? 
  2. What is the evidence for the effect of occupational therapy interventions for adults with musculoskeletal disorders of the lower extremity (pelvis, hip, leg, ankle, and foot)? 
  3. What is the evidence for the effect of occupational therapy interventions for adults with musculoskeletal disorders of the spine (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar)? 



**Method**

Search terms for the reviews were developed by the research methodologist to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) Project and AOTA staff, in consultation with the review authors of each question, and by the advisory group. The search terms were developed not only to capture pertinent articles but also to make sure that the terms relevant to the specific thesaurus of each database were included. The original search strategy for the upper extremity (UE) and low back focused questions was used for the updated reviews. Additional search terms were added to ensure maximum coverage of those questions. A search strategy was created for the full reviews of spine and lower extremity (LE).

Table E.1 in the original guideline document lists the search terms related to the population (people with musculoskeletal conditions [MSCs]) and types of interventions included in each systematic review. A medical research librarian with experience in completing systematic review searches conducted all searches and confirmed and improved the search strategies. Databases and sites searched included MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ergonomics Abstracts, and OTseeker. In addition, consolidated information sources, such as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were included in the search. These databases include peer-reviewed summaries of journal articles and provide a system for clinicians and scientists to conduct systematic reviews of selected clinical questions and topics. Moreover, reference lists from articles included in the systematic reviews were examined for potential articles, and selected journals were hand searched to ensure that all appropriate articles were included. 

Inclusion and exclusion criteria are critical to the systematic review process because they provide the structure for the quality, type, and years of publication of the literature that is incorporated into a review. The reviews of all three questions were limited to peer-reviewed scientific literature published in English. The intervention approaches examined were within the scope of practice of occupational therapy. The literature included in the reviews was published between January 2006 and June 2014 and included study participants with MSCs. As described earlier, full searches for spine and LE were completed for January 1995 to June 2014. The reviews excluded data from presentations, conference proceedings, non–peer-reviewed research literature, dissertations, and theses. Studies included in the reviews provide Level I, II, and III evidence. 

A total of 21,623 citations and abstracts were included in the reviews. For the question on the upper extremity (UE), there were 5,139 references; for the lower extremity (LE) question, 10,533 references; and for the spine question, 5,951 references. The research methodologist completed the first step of eliminating references on the basis of citation and abstract. The systematic reviews were carried out either by individual review authors or as academic partnerships in which academic faculty worked as faculty pairs or with graduate students. Review teams completed the next step of eliminating references on the basis of citations and abstracts. The full-text versions of potential articles were retrieved, and the review teams determined final inclusion in the review on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

A total of 346 articles were included in the final review: 259 Level I, 24 Level II, and 9 Level III studies. In addition to the three focused questions, the search produced 54 articles on return to work, chronic pain, and burns. These articles were evaluated separately.

## Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence

- Review of Published Meta-Analyses
- Systematic Review with Evidence Tables

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



The teams working on each focused question reviewed the articles according to their quality (scientific rigor and lack of bias) and levels of evidence. Each article included in the review was then abstracted using an evidence table that provides a summary of the methods and findings of the article. American Occupational Therapy (AOTA) staff and the research methodologist reviewed the evidence tables to ensure quality control. All studies are summarized in full in the evidence tables in Appendix F in the original guideline document. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the methods described by Higgins, Altman, and Sterne (2011). The method for assessing the risk of bias of systematic reviews was based on the measurement tool developed by Shea et al. (2007).

## Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations

- Expert Consensus

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



A major focus of the American Occupational Therapy Association's (AOTA's) Evidence-based Practice (EBP) Project is an ongoing program of systematic review of the multidisciplinary scientific literature, using focused questions and standardized procedures to identify occupational therapy–relevant evidence and discuss its implications for practice, education, and research. An evidence-based perspective is founded on the assumption that scientific evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy intervention can be judged to be more or less strong and valid according to a hierarchy of research designs, an assessment of the quality of the research, or both.

AOTA uses standards of evidence modeled on those developed in evidence-based medicine. This model standardizes and ranks the value of scientific evidence for biomedical practice. In this system, the highest level of evidence, Level I, includes systematic reviews of the literature, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In RCTs, participants are randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group, and the outcomes of both groups are compared. Other levels of evidence include Level II studies, in which assignment to a treatment or a control group is not randomized (cohort study); Level III studies, which do not have a control group; Level IV studies, which use a single-case experimental design, sometimes reported over several participants; and Level V studies, which are case reports and expert opinions that include narrative literature reviews and consensus statements. 

The systematic reviews on musculoskeletal conditions (MSCs) summarized in this Practice Guideline were supported by AOTA as part of the EBP Project. AOTA is committed to supporting the role of occupational therapy in this important area of practice.

Previous reviews covering the upper extremity (UE) and low back were completed for January 1986 through December 2005 and updated for January 2006 to June 2014. In addition, full searches for cervical spine and lower extremity (LE) were completed for January 1995 through June 2014. These reviews are crucial because occupational therapy practitioners need access to the results of the latest and best available literature to support interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice for people with musculoskeletal conditions. 

The three research questions for the systematic review were reviewed by the review authors, an advisory group of experts in the field, AOTA staff, and the methodology consultant to the AOTA EBP Project.

## Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations



 **Strength of Recommendations**

**A** –There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm.

**B** –There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.

**C** –There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.

**I** –There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined.

**D** –It is recommended that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits.

**Note** : Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2012). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using it.

## Potential Harms



This Practice Guideline is based on findings from systematic reviews of interventions for people with musculoskeletal conditions (MSCs) that were produced for the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA). The studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic reviews did not explicitly report potential adverse events associated with the interventions evaluated in the studies. If harms were noted, they would have been explicitly reported in the summary of key findings and would have been taken into account in the determination of the recommendations. Before implementing any new intervention with a client, it is always prudent for occupational therapy practitioners to be aware of the potential benefits and harms of the intervention. 

Occupational therapy practitioners should exercise clinical reasoning based on a sound evaluation of the client's strengths and limitations and an understanding of the intervention to determine the potential benefits and harms of an intervention for an individual client. Finally, clinical reasoning is also required to translate the intervention protocols used in the reviewed studies into client-centered, clinically feasible interventions.
