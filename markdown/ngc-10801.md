2  A combination of results from two or more prior studies. 


3  Studies provided consistent results. 


4  Study was started before the first patient enrolled. 


5  Patients treated one way (e.g., cemented hip arthroplasty) compared with a group of patients treated in another way (e.g., uncemented hip arthroplasty) at the same institution. 


6  The study was started after the first patient enrolled. 


7  Patients identified for the study based on their outcome, called "cases" (e.g., failed total arthroplasty) are compared to those who did not have outcome, called "controls" (e.g., successful total hip arthroplasty). 


8  Patients treated one way with no comparison group of patients treated in another way.

# Scope

## Disease/Condition(s)



Occipital neuralgia (ON)

## Guideline Category

- Management
- Treatment

## Clinical Specialty

- Neurological Surgery
- Neurology

## Intended Users

- Physicians

## Guideline Objective(s)



To systematically review the medical literature and provide recommendations for the use of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) for the treatment of patients with medically refractory occipital neuralgia (ON).

**Note** : The Task Force restricted their analysis to the use of ONS for the treatment of ON. This technique has also been used for the treatment of other disorders, most prominently migraine headaches. Given the heterogeneity of that diagnosis, they did not include it in this set of guidelines.

## Target Population



Patients with medically refractory occipital neuralgia (ON)

## Interventions and Practices Considered



Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS)

## Major Outcomes Considered



  * Change in visual analog scale (VAS) 
  * Change in short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire 
  * Improvement in the Pain Disability Index score 
  * Symptom improvement 
  * Use of analgesic medication 



# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



**Literature Search**

A systematic literature search was undertaken to address the primary question: Is occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) an effective treatment for occipital neuralgia (ON)? Using the PubMed database, a search of articles published between 1966 and April 2014 was conducted using the following text word combinations: "occipital nerve stimulation and occipital neuralgia" or "electrical stimulation and occipital neuralgia" or "neuromodulation and occipital neuralgia" or "peripheral neurostimulation and occipital neuralgia" or "occipital nerve stimulation and cervicogenic headache" or "neuromodulation and cervicogenic headache" or "occipital nerve stimulation and C2 headache." These searches generated lists of 50, 38, 21, 11, 11, 6, and 10 articles, respectively. Each article was reviewed by at least 2 independent reviewers to determine whether they met the qualifications for full text review. Cochrane Library was also searched with a combination of the keywords used to search PubMed (see the Supplemental Digital Content document [see the "Availability of Companion Documents" field]); however, no unique results were located.

The Task Force performed a secondary literature search to see whether there were interventions that predict response to ONS in ON. Using the PubMed database up to June 2014, the following text words were combined for the search: "occipital nerve block and occipital nerve stimulation" or "occipital nerve block and occipital nerve stimulation and occipital neuralgia" or "occipital nerve blocks predictive of occipital nerve stimulation" or "response to occipital nerve stimulation and occipital neuralgia" or "occipital nerve block and stimulation response" or "occipital nerve block predictive of peripheral nerve stimulation" or "predictors of occipital peripheral nerve stimulation" or "predictors of peripheral nerve stimulation and occipital neuralgia" or "occipital nerve injections and occipital neuralgia" or "occipital nerve injection and occipital nerve stimulation." A total of 89 unique articles were found. Only 8 articles looked at an intervention in patients with ON and none of these articles included patients with ONS. Cochrane Library was also searched with a combination of the keywords used to search PubMed (see the Supplemental Digital Content document); however, no unique results were located.

**Article Inclusion Criteria**

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) clinical series must have a minimum of 3 patients undergoing ONS for treatment of medically refractory ON, (2) clinical series must have a minimum of 2 months postoperative follow-up from ONS implantation, and (3) series that enrolled mixed patient populations were included only if they reported separate results for the target ON population. The results of the target population were the only results considered as evidence to support the recommendations. A total of 81 unique articles were found. Clinical series containing 3 or more patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 months were pooled for analysis.

Of the 81 articles, 72 studies were excluded for the following reasons: 1 was an abstract only, 2 were animal studies, 4 were not in English, 11 were case reports with a single patient, 6 were meta-analyses, 17 were review articles, 30 addressed either an alternative disease process (e.g., trigeminal neuralgia or chronic migraines) or a treatment option other than ONS (e.g., occipital nerve blocks), and 1 was a mixed population of patients that did not separate the results for each population group. Ultimately, 9 original articles were selected and retrieved for analysis. These articles are listed in the Evidentiary Table (see Table 2 in the original guideline document).

A secondary analysis of the 9 selected articles was also performed in an effort to address any significant anatomic or technical considerations for ONS implantation. All of the 9 articles made at least 1 reference to an anatomic and/or technical aspect of ONS, which are also shown in Table 2 of the original guideline document.

## Number of Source Documents



Nine primary articles addressed the efficacy of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) for the specific treatment of occipital neuralgia (ON) (see Table 2 in the original guideline document). All articles provided Class III Level evidence. Three articles were prospective case series without a control group and as such were graded as Class III. One article was a cohort study in which each patient served as his or her own control. However, the data were collected and reviewed retrospectively, making this Class III evidence as well. Four articles were retrospective case series, thus accounting for their classification. Finally, 1 article did not specify whether it was prospective or retrospective, but, given it was a small case series, it was also graded as Class III.

## Description of the Methods Used to Analyze the Evidence



 **Grading Evidence**

The strength of evidence of each article that underwent full text review was graded according to the criteria established by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC). Each article was independently graded by multiple reviewers, and any conflicts between the reviewers' grading was resolved via discussion. The class of evidence (i.e., Class I, II, or III) assigned to each article was determined after review of the sample size, study design, follow-up, and outcome measures (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence" field).

## Description of Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations



 **Guideline Task Force**

A multidisciplinary task force of volunteer neurosurgeons and pain management physicians comprised the Guidelines Task Force and were responsible for the formation of these evidence-based guidelines.

**Guideline Panel Consensus**

The literature searches were performed by a single member of the group and distributed to the entire group for literature review, article selection, and the formation of the evidentiary table. Task Force subgroups were then established by topic. Information was compiled by that subgroup and then distributed to the entire group for review until a final consensus by means of group discussion, voting, and approval was achieved.

The Task Force implemented a modified structured voting technique to finalize and approve the recommendations and strength of recommendations presented in this review. If and when a disparity in opinions occurred, every effort was made to amend the guideline to adequately address each viewpoint until all members were in agreement. In the event that a unanimous decision could not be made, the question was posed to the Task Force as a whole, and the majority opinion was used. This method was agreed upon by all members of the Task Force.

**Levels of Recommendations**

The strength of clinical recommendations (i.e., Level I, II, or III) was linked to the level of evidence included to support the recommendation (see the "Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations field").

## Description of Method of Guideline Validation



 **Practice Guideline Approval Process**

The completed systematic review was distributed to the Joint Guidelines Committee (JGC) of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) for consideration of endorsement by the CNS Executive Committee and the AANS Board of Directors. JGC reviewers were permitted to critique the content and methodology used to create this systematic review. Any concerns of the JGC were addressed by the Task Force, and the document was resubmitted to the JGC for endorsement. In addition, these guidelines were independently submitted to the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the American Interventional Headache Society for review and were approved for endorsement by these organizations. As such, support of these guidelines was also multidisciplinary in nature. Once this process was completed, the document was submitted for publication. This was editorially independent of the funding agencies of the CNS Executive Committee and the AANS/CNS Joint Pain Section Executive Committee, whose involvement occurred after the approval of the guidelines by the JGC and was limited to acceptance versus rejection of endorsement of the work.

The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for the recommendation (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) constitutes a promising therapy for medically refractory occipital neuralgia (ON) because it is reversible with minimal side effects and has shown continued efficacy with long-term follow-up.

## Potential Harms



  * The major technical problem of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) is lead migration, ranging in several prospective studies on ONS for the treatment of migraines from 13.9% to 24%. 
  * Complications of ONS from the 9 primary articles are summarized and shown in Table 3 in the original guideline document. 



# Qualifying Statements

## Qualifying Statements


  * The literature review and presented evidence-based guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary group of physician volunteers. The purpose of these guidelines is to serve as an educational resource assessing the currently available scientific evidence pertaining to the use of occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) for the treatment of medically refractory occipital neuralgia (ON). The guidelines in this article are based on up-to-date information at the time of completion of this document. These guidelines are not intended to be a rigid protocol, and clinical interventions may vary according to a patient's needs. Clinical judgment should always take precedence in the treatment of patients. These guidelines are presented with the understanding that they are not meant to replace the individualized care and treatment of a specific patient by his or her physician(s). These guidelines may not be suitable in all situations or applicable to all patients with ON. Implementation of these guidelines should be done by a patient's managing physician(s) in accordance with each patients individual circumstances and clinical needs. 
  * The primary limitation of this guideline is the current level of evidence available for the use of ONS specifically for the treatment of medically refractory ON. Although prospective, randomized, controlled trials and other well-designed studies demonstrating the effectiveness of ONS have been conducted, the patient populations evaluated in these studies were not specific to medically refractory ON patients. Prospective comparative studies are needed to fully determine the long-term utility of ONS for the treatment of ON. It will be difficult to conduct blinded trials of ONS because the therapy depends on the production of paresthesia detected by the patient in the painful region. The closest alternative is the use of subthreshold stimulation, but there are some who believe that even subthreshold stimulation can result in a therapeutic effect. Research also needs to be conducted into the optimal region for lead placement and the optimal lead type.
