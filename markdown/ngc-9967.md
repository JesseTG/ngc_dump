# Recommendations

## Major Recommendations



#####  Note from the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC): The following guidance was current as of May 2013. Because UMHS occasionally releases minor revisions to its guidance based on new information, users may wish to consult the original guideline documentfor the most current version. 


**Note from NGC** : The following key points summarize the content of the guideline. Refer to the full text for detailed information on each of the screening procedures. 


The strength of recommendation (I-III) and levels of evidence (A-D) are defined at the end of the "Major Recommendations" field. 


###  Key Points 


####  General Principles 


  * Viral pathogens cause most cases of pharyngitis: around 90% in adults and 70% in children _[C]_ . 
  * The primary reason to identify and treat group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is to decrease the risk of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) _[IB]_ . The endemic incidence of ARF is around 0.23-1.88/100,000. 
  * Early treatment of GAS can decrease the time a patient is symptomatic by 1-2 days from a typical 3-7 days _[IB]_ and can decrease the period of contagiousness _[IB]_ . 




####  Diagnosis 


  * Signs/symptoms of severe sore throat, fever, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, red pharynx with tonsillar swelling +/- exudate, and no cough indicate a higher probability of GAS pharyngitis for both adults and children. Algorithms of epidemiologic and clinical factors improve diagnosis by identifying patients with an exceedingly low risk of GAS infection _[C]_ . 
  * Laboratory confirmation: 
    * Neither culture nor rapid antigen screen differentiate individuals with GAS pharyngitis from GAS carriers with an intercurrent viral pharyngitis. 
    * Consider clinical and epidemiological findings (see Table 2 in the original guideline document) when deciding to perform a microbiological test _[IB]_ . 
    * Patients with manifestations highly suggestive of a viral infection such as coryza, scleral conjunctival inflammation, hoarseness, cough, discrete ulcerative lesions, or diarrhea, are unlikely to have GAS infection and generally should NOT be tested for GAS infection _[IIB]_ . 
  * Throat culture is the presumed "gold standard" for diagnosis. Rapid streptococcal antigen tests identify GAS more rapidly, but have variable sensitivity _[B]_ . 
    * Reserve rapid strep tests for patients with a reasonable probability of having GAS. 
    * Confirm negative screen results by culture in patients  <16 years old (and consider in parents/siblings of school age children) due to their higher risk of acute rheumatic fever _[IIC]_ . 
    * If screening for GAS in very low risk patients is desired, culture alone is cost-effective _[IIC]_ . 




####  Treatment 


  * Penicillin V is the drug of choice in patients who can swallow pills. 
  * If using suspension, amoxicillin is better tolerated than penicillin V due to the salty/bitter taste. 
  * Amoxicillin as a single daily dose (1 gram/day) for 10 days is as effective as penicillin V or amoxicillin given multiple times per day for 10 days. 
  * A single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine avoids the problem of adherence, but is painful. 
  * If allergic to penicillin, a 10-day course of a first generation cephalosporin is indicated if no history of a type I hypersensitivity to penicillin. Oral clindamycin is an acceptable alternative, if one is unable to use a first generation cephalosporin. 
  * A macrolide is also acceptable for patients allergic to penicillins (resistant rates range 5-8%). 
  * Children with a recurrence of GAS pharyngitis shortly after completing a course of an oral antimicrobial agent can be retreated with the same agent, given an alternative oral drug, or given an intramuscular injection of penicillin G benzathine (expert opinions differ). 
  * Antibiotics must be started within 9 days after onset of acute illness and continued for 10 days (5 days for azithromycin) to eradicate GAS from the upper respiratory tract and prevent ARF _[D]_ . 




####  Controversial Areas 


  * Diagnosis over the telephone based on symptoms alone without lab testing is unreliable _[IIID]_ . 
  * Based on a phone description, a nurse triage algorithm may guide screening for GAS _[IID]_ . 
  * When an appropriately symptomatic patient is ≥3 years old and has a family member recently diagnosed with laboratory confirmed GAS pharyngitis, one may treat without screening _[IID]_ . 




###  Definitions: 


####  Levels of Evidence 


  1. Randomized controlled trials 
  2. Controlled trials, no randomization 
  3. Observational trials 
  4. Opinion of expert panel 




####  Strength of Recommendation 


  1. Generally should be performed 
  2. May be reasonable to perform 
  3. Generally should not be performed

# Methodology

## Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence

- Hand-searches of Published Literature (Primary Sources)
- Searches of Electronic Databases

## Description of Methods Used to Collect/Select the Evidence



The literature search for this update began with the results of the literature search performed for the 2006 version of this guideline performed in June 2005. A search for literature published since that time was performed. The search on Medline was conducted prospectively for literature published from 6/1/05 to 3/30/11. One set of searches used the major keywords of: GAS pharyngitis (streptococcal infections, streptococcus pyogenes, pharyngitis, pharynx), strep throat; human; English; guidelines, controlled trials, cohort studies. Within these major keywords, specific searches were performed for the following topics: history; physical exam, signs, symptoms throat culture (strep culture); rapid strep screen; observation; antibiotics, other treatment/management, rheumatic fever or group A strep reactive arthritis; and other references found under the major search terms. Specific search terms and strategy are available upon request. Another set of searches used the major keywords of viral pharyngitis/viral sore throat with specific searches performed for: alternative and complimentary therapies (e.g., zinc, vitamin C, echinacea); other treatment.

The search was conducted in components each keyed to a specific causal link in a formal problem structure (available upon request). The search was supplemented with recent clinical trials known to expert members of the panel. Negative trials were specifically sought. The search was a single cycle.

The Executive Committee for Clinical Affairs of the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers endorsed the final version.

# Evidence Supporting the Recommendations

## Type of Evidence Supporting the Recommendations



The type of supporting evidence is identified and graded for some of the recommendations (see the "Major Recommendations" field).

# Benefits/Harms of Implementing the Guideline Recommendations

## Potential Benefits



  * The most important goal in treating group A streptococcal (GAS) infection is to decrease the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). 
  * Appropriate management of individuals with pharyngitis, including those at high risk for complications of GAS (e.g., ARF) 



## Potential Harms


  * The value of early diagnosis in the minority of cases when group A streptococcal (GAS) infection is present and identified by antigen testing must be weighed against the higher total laboratory charges for the majority of non-GAS pharyngitis cases which require a confirmatory throat culture in patients less than 16 years old. 
  * Antibiotic side effects may include rash, nausea, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea. A single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin produces a significant amount of pain at the injection site that may last a number of days, as well as increased risk of anaphylaxis. 
  * Azithromycin could cause potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm in some patients. At-risk patients include those with a slower-than-normal heartbeat, with potassium or magnesium deficiencies, and those using medications to treat existing heart arrhythmia.
